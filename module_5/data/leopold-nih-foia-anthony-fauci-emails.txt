Dear Dr. Fauci: I am an ex-alumni from the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the NIH. Iam sorry to bother but I wanted to notify the Coronavirus Task force about potential blood shortages if blood  centers get blood drive cancellations due to the fear in the public.

We are starting to see this locally and rny concern is that other blood centers in the country are facing the same issue.

Itried to contact the office of the vice president, and all I could do was to send an email, which might get lost among thousands.

Iam hoping you see this and perhaps bring this to the table. Blood centers use updated federal information when educating donors, staff and hospitals but the current fear is triggering blood drive cancellations. This might be experienced nationally and will impact the national blood inventory.

Thank you

Dear Dr. Fauci,


First let me say we are very grateful to everyone at NIH for working to contain the coronavirus, especially your team at the NIAID.  Your interviews are articulate and informative - they give Americans some comfort and some concrete ways to think about protecting themselves and what to expect.  It must be a stressful time and we want you to know that we have confidence in our NIH and CDC to contain it and to help stave it off globally as well.

On a happier note, Iwanted to reach out and THANK YOU for a ll you do for our Down Syndrome research through the transformative trans-NIH INCLUDE program. It is making a HUGE difference!!


To this end, I am writing today in hopes you will be able to join us on Wednesday, May 20th for our AcceptAbili ty Gala at my head table. Attached is our save the date for the event. We are excited to have Caroline Cardenas as our 2020 Ambassador, Rep Pete Stauber as our keynote	(b) (6)
,and Reps Lucille Roybal-Allard and Jaime Herrera Beutler are Global's Quincy Jones
Exceptional Advocacy Awardees.  We believe the gala will be quite lovely and meaningful to so many.


We do understand that attendance cannot be considered if the coronavirus situation worsens. However, if things are looking much better (touch wood) we would be deeply honored if you and our friends from NIAID could attend. looking forward to hearing from you soon.

All the Best,Michelle and family

Dr. Miriam Kelty formerly of NIH referred me to you.  Iam on the board of directors and planning
committee of the Applied Superconductivity Conference that is planned to be held in Tampa, Florida the last week of July. Over 50% of our expected 1500 attendees are from outside the continental US. Our planning committee appears to have three options:
1. Hold the conference on the original dates
2. Postpone the conference a few months
3.  Cancel the conference

It would be most helpful to decision process if you can give us a prediction (anonymously of course) of how the effects of the virus will pan out.
Ilook forward to your reply. Bruce Strauss

Dear Ms. Angel:
   The severe complication of coronavirus are heavily skewed towards the elderly and those with underlying conditions (Heart disease, Chronic lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, etc.) Most of the pneumonias are pure viral pneumonia and so this vaccination will not help that.  However, on the chance that you have a pure viral pneumonia that gets secondarily complicated by a bacterial pneumonia (pneumococcal) the vaccine would be beneficial.  If you are 65 years of age or older, you should get the pneumonvax23 vaccine anyway regardless of the risk of coronavirus infection.

Good evening!


I know you must be completely busy and inundated with people wanting your time. Iapologize that I have nothing to offer in return and completely understand if you don't have time to answer. Icalled the CDC but they were totally unhelpful. I have a question that makes sense to me and Iwas hoping you could answer and the answer might help a lot of people.

I understand that over time I, and everyone else, will very likely get COVID-19 and that most people won't even realize it because it will be minor.  I get that, so this is not a panicked question.

I also understand that while most cases will not be severe, the bad cases are complicated by pneumonia .

So my question is : If someone has been vaccinated against pneumonia, will that offer any protection in the event that they do contract COVID-19 and perhaps provide some barrier against the worst effects?

Thank you for your time if you have read this and Iapologize if this is just another in a long line of ignorant questions, but it made sense in my brain so Ithought I would at least ask.

Be well, be happy, and may life be kind and generous to you, those you love, and those who love you!

sincerely, Aliantha Angel

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Iapologize in advance for this email. I am sure you are too busy these days to answer coronavirus questions from the general public. However, you are the only individual I know of who can be trusted to speak intelligently about the pandemic.

I know there is no preventive vaccine or cure, and there probably won't be for quite some time­
-despite what our ersatz President says. But there is something I don't understand. Since the coronavirus causes pneumonia, wouldn't it be a good idea to vaccinate more of the general population with Pneumovax 23 or Prevnar 13? That certainly wouldn't prevent people from catching coronav irus, but perhaps the resulting penumonia onsets might be a little weaker/short- lived?	(b) (6
  Ifigured it couldn't hurt, right?


Bravo for your efforts to keep our population intelligently informed on this situation.

Subject: Meeting to Assess Evaluation of COVI0-19 vaccine candidates for risk of enhanced disease Dear  Doctor  Fauci,
Iam writing to you as a member of the SPEAC project which CEPI has funded to assist with the evaluation of the safety of vaccines in their portfolio.  As part of this effort, we are assisting with developing preclinical and clinical testing criteria to evaluate the risk of enhanced disease following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine candidates.  As you know, this had been an issue with some prior SARS vaccine candidates.

We are convening a two day virtual meeting of experts via video conference next week on March 12 and 13 between 8 am and 1pm Eastern time each day.  Participants in the meeting are shown in the attached agenda but include Paul Henri Lambert from Geneva and Barney Graham from NIH. The meeting will actively involve the participants on the agenda the first day

and on the second day the meeting will be open for several peer reviewers including Stanley Plotkin and Andy Pollard to review and comment on possible small and NHP animal models as well as appropriate immunologic testing to be done in early phase one trials.

I am wanted to make you aware of the meeting so that you could attend all or part as an observer if you wish but also to invite you to consider joining on day two as one of our formal peer reviewers.  The goal of the meeting would be to share recommendations with CEPI COVID-19 developers as well as other interested parties.

Any comments you have on the agenda or draft questions for consideration would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Dr Fauci
My name is Patti Taylor and I'm a nurse. Been one for 30 years.

                                 .   Sounds too simple.  Anyway I was thinking of the Coronavirus and maybe it bas something like an autoimmune part to it that makes a person unable to fight back.....
Just a thought. I think a lot.

Subject: How to put COVID-19 statistics in perspective


Today (March 3), CNN featured a discussion with NY Gov. Cuomo regarding a new COVID-19 case in NY City. He happened to note that there are currently about 15,000 patients in NY hospitals with the flu. Although multiple government agencies,scientists and health experts keep reminding us that there are far more cases, hospitalizations and deaths each year from influenza than this coronavirus, it strikes me that a more effective, more visual and less fear-producing way of presenting this information would be to present the current number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from EACH of these diseases side by side. If the number of flu cases, hospitalizations and/or deaths isn't available on a daily basis, we could use extrapolations based on known rates. Ithink this would certainly go a long way to putting the relative risks of these diseases in clearer focus.

Dr. Fauci,
Ifirst want to thank you for your service and efforts in combating this international health problem.


I'm neither a physician or a scientist so please accept my apology if my idea is simplistic or isn't feasible. But Iwas thinking about some of the information presented on why it seems to be less prevalent in children. One theory is that they are exposed to so many other coronavirus's that they experience cross­ protection. So Iwas wondering if anyone had investigated the idea to flood adults with other, less lethal, coronavirus's as a way to develop some level of immunity? Ideally coronavirus's that are a match to
what children would be exposed to is what I'm suggesting here. I wouldn't expect that this will totally protect an adult but it might reduce the severity of the illness if an adult becomes ill and help while a vaccine and treatments are launched.
Thank you for considering this idea. Best,
Jeff

Dear Dr. Fauci -


Thank you for helping millions of people with your research over the years.


The following information was culled from http://poleshift.ning.com.


Perhaps this article may help you and your colleagues develop a vaccine that may combat the Corona Virus. You were the first one Ithought of who may be able to deem its wor th and explore its research for practical purposes.
Some of the links have included nih.gov so maybe your colleagues have already read this.
With my limited medical knowledge,Ihave taken the liberty to highlight key points that seem important. Wishing you and yours all the best for remaining healthy in Mind, Body & Spirit.
Warm Regards & Appreciation,

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Thank you for your useful editorial published in NEJM last week, it helps confirming that the situation does not need to be as glim as the panic that most people are experiencing.
I am writing an editorial and hoping to submit it to The Lancet soon. Differently from NIH/US
Government institutes, Ihave more room for reflection in my viewpoint.


For that reason, Iwas wondering if I can have a call with you to get your opinion/advice on the direction of my editorial. Iknow how busy you are and Ican understand if you do not have the time, but if by chance you are willing to have this call, I'll be happy to share my editorial's draft first.
As a background, Iam an EIS graduate (class of 2009), and trained by Robert T. Chen.

Since the  elderly's response to pulmonary coronavirus infection may be impaired , especially  in those with a chronic disorder, is there any information  re: delivering by inhalation, low concentra tions of a Zinc salt. ls there a potential rationale in early coronaviru s infection to try to minimize serious pneumonia , were such inhalation shown to be reasonably  safe?

Subject:Possible treatment of COV ID-19 pneumonia


Dear Dr. Fauci,

Nitric Oxide (NO) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus­ induced pneumonia in mouse model (Zablockiene et al.,2012).

Zablockiene 8, Ambrozaitis A, Kacergius T, Gravenstein S. Implication of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection.Biologija 2012; 58(1): 15-25.


NO overproduction in influenza virus pneumonia results from a sustained stimulation of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) (Akaike et al., 1996).

Akaike T, Noguchi Y, lj iri S, Setoguchi K, Suga M, Zheng YM, Dietzschold 8, Maeda H. Pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced pneumonia: involvement of both nitric oxide and oxygen radicals. Proc Natl Acad Sci US A. 1996Mar19; 93(6):2448-53.

NO overproduction in influenza virus-induced pneumonia can generate highly reactive oxygen species, peroxynitrite, via radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide

[resulting from influenza virus-induced increased levels of xanthine oxidase (XO) (Maeda and Akaike, 1998).

Maeda H, Akaike T. Nitric oxide and oxygen radicals in infection, inflammation, and cancer. Biochemistry (Mose). 1998 Jul; 63(7):854-65

Peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration reactions of various biomolecules (Akaike and Maeda, 2000) .

Akaike T, Maeda H. Nitric oxide and virus infection. Immunology.2000 Nov;
101(3):300-8.


The crucial role of NO in influenza virus-induced pneumonia was demonstrated on iNOS gene knockout mice: at inocula sufficient to cause consolidating pneumonia and death in the wild-type control mice, iNOS gene deficient mice survived with little histopathologic evidence of pneumonia (Karupiah et al., 1998).

Karupiah G, Chen JH, Mahalingam S, Nathan CF, MacMicking JD. Rapid interferon gamma-dependent clearance of influenza A virus and protection from consolidating pneumonitis in nitric oxide synthase 2-deficient  mice. J Exp Med. 1998Oct19; 188(8):1541-6.

Both influenza and coronaviruses could have the same pathogenetic mechanism of inducing pneumonia, namely harmful overproduction NO.

I would like to present you my innovative idea:Suppressing NO overproduction in COVID-19 complicated to pneumonia with Methylene Blue (MB)

Arguments pro:

MB is known as a guanylate/guanylyl cyclase inhibitor but it is mainly a NOS inhibitor (nNOS and iNOS).

MB is an inhibitor of superoxide generation by xanthine oxidase and NADH/NADPH
oxidases.

MB is a small molecule capable to penetrate in tissues and cells

MB was administered intravenously in patients with refractory septic shock and
Hepatopulmonary Syndrome of advanced liver cirrhosis .

MB administered intravenously will definitively reach the cells where NOS is induced by COVID-19 complicated by pneumonia both in animals and humans:

-Airway epithelium (including alveolar epithelial cells);

-Alveolar macrophages ;

            -Capillary/vascular endothelium (endothelial cells). MB is an inexpensive medication.
MB is non-toxic molecule in humans

There are only a few cases of MB toxicity published in the literature. These cases occurred in very peculiar situations:

Hemolytic anemia in patients with G6-PD deficiency

Severe neuropathology after intrathecal administration of MB Eye injury after topical use of MB
Tissue necrosis due to the extravasation of injected MB

Jejuna! atresia following intra-amniotic MB

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRl's) interact with MB, causing a serious adverse
reaction consistent with serotonin syndrome .

Very truly yours,

Hello Dr. Fauci. Iam a	(b) (6) pharmacist from Ontario, Canada. I was just reading an article that stated covid-19 cases in children under nine y.o. are almost non-existant. Iwondered why, and then an answer dawned on me.They have an immunity because one of the childhood vaccines all children get is giving them cross immunity to coronavirus as well. A study should be done immediately to see which one gives cross immunity, if indeed that is the reason for their seeming immunity to this virus. The immunity must wear off over time which is why adults and seniors seem to lack prior immunity and get sick. This hypothesis is certainly worth investigating. If this is what is happening,maybe millions of lives could be saved by a simple booster of an existing vaccine. Please let me know your thoughts on this matter. Thanks for your time. Rob

Folks, we're doing a story that focuses in part on the administration's conference call from last Thursday noon about a decision to send out more CDC coronavirus assays despite the fact that they had become contaminated and compromised. We understand that Dr. Fauci was one of four federal doctors (the others being Drs. Hahn, Shuren and Shah) who strongly recommended the assays not be sent out.
Iwant to give Dr. Fauci a chance, on or off the record, to comment on the story please.
Thank you, Tom Burton

Additionally, he plans to ask Dr. Schuchat a few questions abou t CDC covering patient costs from quarantine.

Thank you very much and look forward to seeing you all or your colleagues tomorrow.

Best,
HELP team



Questions for Dr. Fauci:

Subject:Re: Q


This is the descriptive portion of my column. Idon't want to over or under-state:


     America is entering a disturbing new stage in the coronavirus outbreak. There has been community spread in at least one and likely two locations in Washington State. And it appears the virus was being transmitted for at least a few weeks before current cases were recognized. So we can expect dozens or hundreds of cases in those locations unless contact tracing is especially efficient.
That means the disease is loose and easily transmitted.
The crucial issue now is the real mortality rate, which remains
uncertain. The stated mortality is 2 percent. American experts are hoping the rate turns out to be considerably lower. But the math remains troubling in any case. If only s percent of the population eventually gets infected
(which is on the low side of some estimates) and the mortality rate is 1
percent , there still would be a few hundred thousand deaths.

     At this stage, the main tool that public health experts have is social distancing -the attempt to keep as many people as possible in affected areas out of sneezing distance from one another. This means measures such as closing schools, cancelling events in theaters and stadiums and encouraging employees to telework. States and localities ultimately make such decisions rather than the federal government. But according to some health experts I consulted, Washington State should be taking such measures right now. The effectiveness of social distancing is limited when action comes too late or ends too early.
The goal of such policies is to keep the Ro (reproduction ratio) as low
as possible. When people are in close proximity, a single infected person
can spread the disease to several others, boosting the Ro of the disease as
high as 2 to 3and causing an exponential increase in cases. If the Ro is less than one, the epidemic will gradually decline and stop on its own, with or
without a vaccine.
A vaccine, however, would be tremendously helpful. There are at least
ten vaccine development projects underway. But the one furthest along at
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is still about six weeks away from starting the process of a phase 1trial in human volunteers that will take 3 to 4 months to complete and to show that the vaccine safe and produces specific antibodies. A phase 2 trial will follow and will take at least 6 to 8 months to determine if the vaccine is efficacious in people at risk for infection . Then production would need to be scaled up by a willing pharmaceutical company to deal with a global crisis. All this in total will take at least a year - assuming there are no unpredicted scientific obstacles in the way.

 Socialdistancing is not really geared to wait for a vaccine. The major point is to prevent easy spread of infections in schools (closing them), crowded events such as theaters, stadiums (cancel events), work places (do teleworking where possible). States and localities make these decisions, not the Federalgovernment. The goal of social distancing is to prevent a single person who is infected to readily spread to several others, which is facilitated by close contact in crowds. Close proximity of people will keep the RO higher than 1and even as high as 2 to 3.  If we can get the RO to less than 1, the epidemic will gradually decline and stop on its own without a vaccine.

Is the overall strategy for social distancing just to keep the percentage of Americans who get the disease low until a vaccine is available? This seems much harder to do in a free society. Does this mean closing schools? Public transport? Do states and localities make such decisions?

 Thanks for the note. We are clearly getting "community spread" in at least one and likely two non-contiguous locations.

The precise mortality rate is still uncertain.   The stated

mortality is 2%; however, even if it is half that (1%) and only 5% of the population get infected, you are correct in that we can have a few hundred thousand deaths. The really critical issue is what the mortality rate actually turns out to be.  I am hoping for a considerably lower mortality rate, but that might be wishful thinking. Whatever it turns out to be, the major tools that we have are public health measures, particularly social distancing, which we have to start doing right now in Washington State and thinking about in other locations. That is really the major weapon that we have. Even though we go into phase 1with one candidate vaccien in about 6 weeks, vaccine is out of the question for at least a year or more if you want to make sure that you have an effective vaccine, i.e. some efficacy data before massive deployment . We are meeting with pharmaceutical executive today and Iwill bring up the issue of what the fastest possible trmeline would be to have a deployable vaccine.

Tony,


Iwas with Francis yesterday, and the news seemed pretty sobering. It seems like the virus is out in the general population in the Pacific Northwest and Silicon Valley.A pandemic now appears likely. Francis gave me a guesstimate that 5 to 20 percent of the US population may end up infected. Depending on the mortality rate, this could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Not for attribution in any way, is this a fair summary? How and when will we know if the disease is on this track? Do we have any better info on mortality yet?

And is there any news on the vaccine front? As Iunderstand it, we are not even to Phase 1trials on anything. If a vaccine is promising, are well talking about late Fall as the earliest possibility? And are there any substantive measures that could be taken to make sure pharma steps up to produce a vaccine on a massive scale once we have It?

I'm not sure Americans have been adequately prepared for this possibility. That is partly a political problem (in my view). But what needs to happen soon to get people prepared?

Hope you are holding up well under all of this and taking care of yourself .

I know you are busy, so forgive me for reaching out directly, but time is of the

I know you spoke with Jon about doing a 60 Minutes story on COVID-19. We are interested in potentially crashing a story for this weekend.
Is it possible for us to have a quick brainstorming phone call on what such a story
might include ifbased at NIH with you?
Some ideas...

Following you closely as you engage in meetings, getting up to date info, giving you1 opinion, going to task force meeting at WH or elsewhere.
Are you using the same "DNA platform" you showed us in theZika story to build a
potential vaccine for COVlD-19? Or is it another approach?
Will you be meeting with any patients who are currently infected? Bringing any
patients to the NIH for care/evaluation?

 OK, well  that is good to know. It has been reported  by many outlets including the NYT. So if not true I think it is critically  irnp01tant for you to say so publicly  and show that it is not the case. It is critical, critical that we all have faith in the science and medical leadership. Your personal integrity is at stake here in the community and the world, and is a proxy for the integrity of science and medicine.
According to one house member, the following:
Garamendi told MSNBC's Hallie Jackson that Anthony Fauci was scheduled to do all five major Sunday talk shows, but says Fauci canceled the appearances after Vice President Pence took over the administration's  response to the disease .


Trump on Wednesday named Pence as the official overseeing the
government's response.


"I can repeat what he said, he said, 'I was not muzzled. However, I was to go on the Sunday talk shows five of them.The vice president's office then took over the control of this situation, and told me to stand down, not to do those shows,"' Garamendi said, quoting Fauci.

We cannot mince words about this or have nuances. Ifyou were told not to appear on Sunday talk shows, then a reasonable person would have to assume your speech indeed is being controlled . Whether you call it "muzzled" or censored is a matter of semantics. ls it factual that you were told/asked not to appear on these shows as bad been scheduled?

I hope you understand my reason for and level of concern. I am certain it is shared
by many of yom colleagues and citizens.

Dear Board members,


Thank you to those of you who joined the call on Thursday on short notice.


In light of our discussion, we would like to update you on a few matters:

(b)(4













 Coronavirus outbr eak. We have asked Jeremy Farrar to act as the Board's focal point on the COVI0-19 outbreak, to represent and advise the Board on the science of the outbreak and the financing of the response. We thank Jeremy for agreeing to take on this role.

 Follow-up Board teleconference call.

Dear Dr. Fauci (and Hilary, if you end up doing this event as AS F's back-up),

I've attached an "event rundown" for the Harvard Forum Webcast, which is scheduled from 11:40-lpm on Monday 3/2-a moderated panel discussion. This is a document prepared by the event organizers outlining the run of show, noting what questions the moderator will pose, and some suggested points the organizers thought you might touch on in your answers.

Although the organizers prepared this document following a planning call, they have made it clear that the "talking points" in this document are of course not a script. I have taken their document and highlighted where you appear. I have also added some comments.
Let me know what you think. There are no slides for this event.


Let me know if you would Iike to discuss further over the weekend or if you'd like anything for preparation.

Subject:personal Immune .baseline and its impact on infection and vaccine responses Dear Or . Fauci,
Hope you are doing well despite the rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19.


Iwanted to send you a paper we just published last week that you might find relevant - please find
attached and a NIAID piece below.


https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/immune-system-status    -predicts-future-responses

This paper asks the question of why do individuals mount variable immune responses to vaccines, infections, and diseases. This extends from our earlier work on baseline predictors of influenza vaccination responses that you highlighted as a NIAID Advance in 2014. A key message is that genetics is often unlikely the answer, but the status of the immune system before the perturbation may offer clues
- here we identified such an immune cell circuit involving pDCs-Type I IFNs prior to perturbation in humans and found that its status can predict vaccinat ion and lupus disease activities and is temporally stable within individuals for months.

Tony,


I know you're swamped but I'm wondering if we could arrange for you this week to take questions from our readers about coronavirus. All of our coronavirus coverage is in front of STAT's paywall and we'd see your contribution as an enormous public service.

We would solicit questions for a "live chat" from readers -- and you could pick and choose which ones you want to answer -- and write most of them in advance.

Among other leading figures, we've done this format twice with Nobel winners and it's quite popular .
https://www.statnews .com/events/stat -live-chat-chat-with-a-2019-nobel-winning-scientist/


With Helen Branswell, Sharon Begley, Matt Herper,and our whole team, we pride ourselves on covering the coronavirus in the most authoritative and fair-minded way. We've developed a tremendous audience for this coverage. https://www .statnews.com/tag/coronav irus/

Our readers are fairly sophisticated on health and medicine, and we're looking to focus on the health aspects, not the White House politics.


In addition, I'd be grateful if you'd consider writing another First Opinion for us, maybe on lessons you've learned regarding other outbreaks and how that might be relevant with coronavirus -- or whatever you'd like.

Your voice of course is very important and authoritative and we'd be grateful to have it again in STAT.


All best, Rick

Thank you for responding to my email yesterday about the possibility of ARB therapy
 in treatment of coronavirus infection. I realize that your research is ongoing. Would you anticipate , however, that the ARB with the most potential role in preventing virus attachment would be the one that has the greatest affinity for the AT2 receptor? Am i correct that losartan is the ARB with the lower receptor (AT1 vs AT2) selectivity and might logically be the most promising ARB to investigate? Thanks. Dr Thomas Leopold

Dear Dr Fauci,


I heard this idea on a radio interview with Laurie Garrett this morning - how about getting your committee (or one of the government health agencies) to produce a series of short YouTube videos on how to combat the coronavirus: such thlngs as proper hai1dwashing technique, when to wear a mask, how to ride the subway safely, etc, etc. I think this would be an exceUent way to reach the public in the digital age (provided that Mike Pence doesn't try to turn them into campaign ads for Donald Trump), and I strongly urge you to give the strategy serious consideration. IknowIwould watch them and I'm sure millions of other people would too.

Passing on some main points from of an "HHS COVID-19 Situation Update" call that took place at 3pm today, FYI.


 The meat of the call was a situation update by Nancy Messonnier (with epi numbers below ).
 She noted that the national strategy is still containme nt.
 However, since there are some US locales with evidence of community spread,there is considerat ion if some "community level action" may be appropr iate, with a move towards a blend of mitigation/containment in certain areas.

Global epi update:
China lab/clinically confirmed cases: 79,824 (+573 in last 24h) China deaths: 2,870

61international locations with 7,102 cases so far (Armenia, Ecuador, Ireland, Luxembourg new in last 24h)

107 international deaths


Widespread community transmission occurring in:
China, Iran, Italy, Japan, S. Korea


US epi update:
63 confirmed US cases (16 diagnosed here, 3 in Hubei repatriates, 44 in Diamond princess repatriates) 11presumptive cases (meaning they tested +at state public health labs, but confirmatory test at CDC is pending)
663 Persons Under Investigation

Although outside my main area of expertise Ihave been keeping up with CoVid-19 discussion. One item I have noted is that the disease appears to have a lower incidence in children . The other is that the virus appears to at least in part attach through cell membrane angiotensin II type 1receptors. Isthe lower incidence of the disease in children possibly due to this cohort having a higher proportion of angiotensin II type 2 receptors compared to the adult cohort?

Subject: Invitation to speak to the National Economists Club Dear Dr. Fauci,
My name is Emily Sanchez and Iam an economist at the American Chemistry Council. Iam reaching out
to you in my capacity as President of the National Economists Club (NEC), which is an organization of over 1000 government and private sector economists based in DC. The NEC holds weekly luncheon events which feature notable experts and economists in Washington.

Increasingly, economists are being asked to assess the economic impacts around the incidence and spread of the corona virus as well as the impact of reduced economic activity due to behavioral changes
(e.g. people not leaving their homes to work or shop, supply chain disruptions, etc.). As economists are tasked in assessments, scenario planning and communicating their estimates, accuracy around their assumptions and understanding of the corona virus and Covid-19 is imperative. We are incredibly appreciate of the important work and research that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provides and we are wondering if you would be willing to speak at one of our luncheons about Covid-19 and the latest developments.

Do you think you might have time in your schedule to speak to the National Economist Club this
month? We would love to have you speak during the week of March 16-20.


Our luncheons typically take place at the Chinatown Garden Restaurant, 618 H St. NW, with lunch at noon and your presentation from 12:30 p.m.til 1:30 p.m. Talks are normally on the record and open to the press, unless you request otherwise.

Thank you for your consideration. Best regards,
Emily

Reference: I'm the nuclear/aerospace engineer who subsequently obtained an MPH at the University of Washington since Iwas working disease transmission within commercial airlines when Iwas a Boeing employee. And, my undergraduate degree is in chemistry with a minor in microbiology. I've engaged you previously.

Hi Or . Fauci,

You've kindly allowed me to engage you, and I'lltake advantage of that kindness.


The news media is reporting that the White House has muzzled you.  Is that true? Before entering the science/engineering world, I was a newspaper city editor in Southern CA {in the 1970s). Therefore, Iget and understand the idea of coordinated messaging. {Plus, due to my media background, Boeing used me to help executives prepare for media engagements on challenging topics.) However, if it's true that you are muzzled, then I will initiate a "campaign" with my congressional representatives and the media to

.sto.p th.at .action. --	-(b)(6)

However, before I initiate such a camp aign, will my actions possibly cause you harm? Irecognize that
you may have backchannels that I may disrupt by engaging.


As Irelated previously, Itrust you since you focus on facts and data, you provide context for the information that you share,and you avoid emotion in your engagements. Ithink that residents of the US (and, frankly the world) need your insights regarding COVID-19. Plus, you're one of the world leaders with regard to infectious diseases.And, if you don't know,you know whom to ask.

Please let me know if Ishould stay silent or become noisy.


Thank you. And, thanks for your service to the US and the world during this very interesting time.

Dear Tony,


I wanted to share a very recent and surprising result we've obtained on the mechanism of antibody protection for anti-viral antibodies. We've previously shown that bNAbs to flu and HIV require FcR engagement for their in vivo potency. Enhancing activating FcR engagement increases the potency of these antibodies by an order of magnitude, on average,and thus are significant contributors to anti-viral protection.

Subject:Novel Treatment for Reducing Symptoms Associated with Coronavirus (COVID-19) - "Non­
Confidential" Dear Dr. Fauci,
Sen-Jam Pharmaceutica l has a product under development to reduce the symptoms associated with Upper Respiratory Infection (URI). We believe it could provide relief to a large number of people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our product SJP-002 is a combination of an NSAID and a non-sedating antihistamine and does not include a decongestant.  Removing the decongestant makes our product ideal for treating the symptoms associated with COVID-19 in patients with cardiac conditions who cannot tolerate  taking a decongestant.

What makes our product novel is that it can be administered early in the treatment phase, thereby reducing the excessive accumulation of inflammation, which typically results in head congestion, pulmonary congestion, coughing, & sneezing. Our experience has shown that at the 1st signs of experiencing symptoms of URI an individual's symptoms can be drastically reduced after taking our

product twice a day for 3 days.  The dramatic reduction in inflammation has the potential to reduce the spreading of the virus by means of cough,sneezing, and spreading of germs through contact. Currently, whe n individuals experience the start of a URI,there is little effective intervention available to change the course of the infection .  Individuals delay administering pharmaceutical agents, until their
congestion becomes intolerable and excessive.


Attached is a copy of our early research and a copy of our non-provisional patent.  Ishare this information with the hope of providing some background for an immediately accessible,safe treatment, alternative to slow the pace and impact of the pandemic.

let me now if we can be of any additional help? Thanks and all the best,

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Those of us who seek factual, scientifically -based information to the highest degree that it is possible to obtain it will remain hungry and on the alert for whatever complete, up-to-the-moment information
that you may have as humanity proceeds deeper into the Covid-19 potential pandemic. We have trusted you through several previous epidemics to provide such information. Therefore, I know I'm not alone in being appalled and frightened by President Trump wanting you to issue information about the current crises only after it has been cleared by his administration . In his office as President, Donald Trump may be de facto, Commander-in Chief. There is nothing about his office that confers Expert-in-Chief on him, and what he chooses to say or not say about Covid-19 and its spread should not be treated by the media or anyone as information that is trustworthy for being factual and scientifica lly-based information to the highest degree that it is possible to obtain.

I hope that you will find it in yourself and in the mission of your office to publicly assure the American public in no uncertain terms that you will not be censored, and that you will honor the public's trust to continue to provide real, research-based information about the frightening health nightmare that all humans are facing in a way that distinguishes us from China's government in its disgraceful and destructive efforts to muzzle those experts who might be able to save lives by merely speaking truth to a population whose health depends on having fact-based, totally un-massaged knowledge as soon as it is available.


It is with our lives, the lives of our families, and the lives that make up our nation that we are counting on you.

This is HJ from NPR again . Iwas wondering if you could confirm a NYT report that says the White House has instructed you not to say anything about the coronavirus outbreak without prior approval.

RE: COVID-19  Questions




Bob:
 Thanks for the note.  I hope that all is well with you.  Use an N95 if you have them available. Transmission is similar to influenza : respiratory droplets and likely a bit more as aerosol than with influenza . People can transmit even when they are asymptomatic . No approved therapies; however, we are doing clinical trials on 're-purposed" drugs such as remdesivir (Gilead),  Vaccine going into phase 1trial in about 6 weeks, but will not be ready for at least 1.5 years.
Hope that this is helpful.

Watching the spread of the Coronavirus worldwide(?), Ican't help but feel for you, as well as the world's population.

It must be both challenging as well frustrating to be unable to control every important "leak" and then watching the consequences.

Iwould think it's also sort of exciting, while also being horrible, given this is what you've trained for
most of your professiona l life.
And, Iwould think that most of your other important works need to be put on hold?

Dear Dr. Fauci:
I reviewed the publications about the last 2 coronavirus infections. Both MERS and SARS were severe, short lived problems that have not recurred. One would expect Covir-19 to follow a similar path: infect a wide group of susceptible people and then disappear ,If that is so, anything that is more than six months away may not be of value -remdisivir or a vaccine. Even if remdisivir works, it will take months to produce sufficient amounts to treat this illness.
 Has ribavirin been assessed for an ability to slow down the replication of this virus? We do not need to eradicate the virus . Just slowing down the rate of symptoms progression would allow time for the immune system to mount a curative response.
Ribivirin is the only approved anti-viral that may have shown some clinical benefit against similar coronavirus infections, but the reports are anecdotal and the benefit short term. It was only administered to a few patients who were already on respirator support, and most still died. If their lungs were already destroyed, eliminating the virus would not change the outcome. There were no studies of treating mild illnesses before they progressed to needing respirator support. If the SO year old coronavirus patient described in the Lancet had been treated in first week of symptoms, before needing respiratory support, he may have survived.On autopsy, most of his lung had been destroyed.
If ribavirin has even marginal benefit, decreasing hospitalization by 10% yields an enormous savings. Ido
not have access to the data on this virus and the possible effects of the antivirals that have been evaluated. However, ribavirin has any effect on viral proliferation, we can write and a randomized trial of ribavirin}	CbH4
(b)(4

I look forward to hearing from you about the data on ribavirin against this virus and your thought on this
clinical study. Sincerely,
William H. Sherman, M.D.

Subject: Brookings Invitation

Dr. Fauci,

Greetings from the Brookings Institution. I'm writing to share the attached invitation for you to speak to our Board of Trustees at their annual dinner on Thursday, March 5 here in Washington, DC. The Brookings Board is a distinguished group of business and community leaders ... I know they would be very eager to bear your thoughts, especially on the coronavirus crisis given its spread into the U.S. Ifthis date does not work with

your schedule, we'd be glad to welcome you to Brookings at a more convenient time.

I very much appreciate you considering our request, Dr. Fauci! My very best,
John R. Allen President
The Brookings Institution

Dear Dr. Fauci.

I'll not be at the CROl this year	(b)(6)
Sol hope T may be able to ask
you a few questions as a concerned citizen.

Will we learn:
Why there are new cases in the US of unknown origin?
Could this viru:s in fect carriers who do nol present with :symptom:s or pre:sent in vario u:s levels of very mild
infection and never get identified as infected?
Could individuals host the virus diffenmtly due to genetics or ethnici ty?
Is this virns consistenlly similar after multiple ge11eration or is it capable of mutating?
Ts there an ability to develop an antibooy immunity through in fection?  Can one be rein fected?
Could the level of infection be determmed by the amount of inoculant?
Could we learn the level of infect ability of this virus by testing everyone in a given geographic area where
there is a deep outbreak? We might also learn about the pathogenesis in a way that we cannot learn otherwise.
    If this virus is so transmissible could we end up with almost everyone eventually being infected and present with various levels of serious acute infection and death to indistinguishable cases or just carriers?

With the clamp/filter on infonnation from this administration, please tell us where we may find regular reports at va1ious levels of current science on what we learn about this v irus and vaccine progress, and where we may ask questions? I hope there is place for formal and infonnal community input into treatment, care and vaccine development.

Thank you for all your help over the years with your wise perspect ive through our interviews and leadership at the

NIH in such a reasonable and responsible way.

Subject: Coronavirus - New Idea for treatment & clinical study
Importance: High


Dear Vice President Pence,


We are thankful for your leadership of the White House Coronavirus Task Force in gathering the latest information about the outbreak, working with doctors and scientists to find solutions, and communicating with the general public regarding the situation.  We were blessed to meet with you back in August, 2019, when
had expressed a desire to meet
you. Ihave attached a picture from our meeting to help you remember . We pray for you often.

Since we are both physicians, we have been following the details of the COVID- 19 outbreak closely . My husband was researching the anti-viral drug remdesivir this morning, and he came across some articles from Chinese studies that indicated a very well-known drug called hydroxychloroguine (already widely used for 70 years to treat malaria and rheumatological diseases) had very potent activity against COVID-19 infection and pneumonia. This was rather surprising to us,but as we read about the study and the characteristics of
hydroxychloroquine, we realized that this could be a very good drug to use for the
treatment of high-risk patients infected with COVID-19, who might deteriorate rapidly and progress to hospitalization and need for ICU care.  Remdesivir also seems like an excellent anti-viral drug, but it is given intravenously, and is probably reserved for COVID-19 patients who are already entering into severe respiratory distress in the hospital.


Hydroxychloroquine, on the other hand, is given orally, and is cheap and readily available.
Low doses (6.5 mg I kg) have been effective in the management of Systemic
Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. 200 mg tablets are usually prescribed twice a day with meals;dosage can be increased up to the recommended 6.5 mg/kg if the patient tolerates the lower dose. We wondered if the low dose hydroxychloroquine would be able to be studied quickly in various
COVID-19 patients, especially those who are older and I or with medical
conditions that put them at higher risk for pneumonia and complications (cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc.).In addition, hydroxychloroguine may even be a useful drug to prevent the development of pneumonia in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.


Because hydroxychloroquine in an older drug that is generic, current pharmaceutical companies have no incentive to do studies or research on its effectiveness for any new medical conditions . Therefore, the federal government would most likely have to construct and fund the studies. Perhaps Dr. Fauci has already considered this kind of study with hydroxychloroquine .


We understand that vaccines are already being studied, and Israel is working on an oral (pill) vaccine. Vaccines take time to go through testing and trials,which is why we are suggesting to you that studies be done on hydroxychloroquine, a readily-ava ilable oral drug that could "bridge the gap" to provide some potential

treatment and mitigation of the COVID-19 infections while vaccines are being
developed and mass produced.


We have attached several articles, which are electronic publications made available in advance (Feb. 4th & Feb 19th, 2020) of the printed journal publications . We will send a copy of this email to Dr.Fauci, Dr. Redfield, and Dr.
Azar .



Sincerely yours,
Ors. Paul & Karyl Stanton

Subject;One solution in the armoury to protect Health Care Sector Workers against Covid-19


Dear Dr Fauci


A PPE device, tested and proven at Public Health England Porton Down (PHE), based on innovative technology could be ready to go into production within 20 weeks. It sterilises all airborne pathogens as air is inhaled by the wearer. See www.medi -immune. com and in particular the published report on the tests, by clicking on the report under "The Science" The device is due to undergo further tests, at PHE within the next week, specifica lly against Covid-19. For verification please contact Professor Nigel Silman at PHE Parton Down.

Health Services around the world are doing what they can to prepare for a significant increase in
infections from this highly transmissible virus and if those people in the Health Care Sectors are infected
the situation could become untenable.


The production of vaccines is under way but no one expects them to be available within the next 12 to 18 months. The Medi-Immune ''ProtectivAir®", which has been under development for some years and could be available within a few months, will give a far greater level of protection than the current masks and respirators and more importantly can remain in use in the future for other emerging airborne pathogens - known, unknown or mutating.


Please take a little time to investigate this option,via the webs ite,or pass it on to those who you believe need to be made aware of it. Iwill be happy to answer any questions, technical or otherwise, at my emai l address below or on my mobile number, also below.

Kind regards

You have no idea how much Ihave admired you across the years, yom intelligence and poise. May I ask how I may help you in this matter, this response, I am not talking about money , I wish
to help, volunteer .



I draw your attention to 2 attachments ...

1) one is a one page I wrote to summarize a meta analysis my team just completed and seeking to publish. It pertains to corticosteroids and ARDS. We are raising that this suggests indirect evidence that we may be able to extrapolate to the COVID patient with severe illness. This
within the life threatening issue and emergency and no effective treatment. I share if this can

help you as I know you are leading this and listened to you today with the president. I support
this president fully.

2) I share a paper published today, it on the other hand raises serious questions on the use of corticosteroids in influenza associated ARDS, and one may argue this patient set, is the closest to the COVID 19 patient.

My sense is that the accumulated evidence thus far is weak and argues against corticosteroids. For example, this recently published multicenter retrospective cohort study in medical center ICUs across Taiwan sought to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids in patients presenting with influenza -associated ARDS (virology-proven ARDS and are on mechanical  ventilation). Researchers examined the impact of early corticosteroid treatment (2: 200 mg hydrocortisone equivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission, determined by a sensitivity analysis) on subsequent hospital mortality. The study revealed that of the 241 patients with influenza ­ associated ARDS, those receiving early corticosteroid had a significantly higher hospital mortality rate than those who did not get early corticosteroid [43.5% (37/85) vs. 19.2% (30/156), p < 0.001]. Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital mortality in overall patients [an adjusted OR of 5.02 (95% CI 2.39-10.54), p < 0.001] and in all examined subgroups. Researchers found that a higher dose and earlier treatment was linked to higher hospital mortality. Moreover, they found that earlier treatment was related to a significantly increased odds of subsequent bacteremia  [an adjusted OR of 2.37 (95% CI 1.01- 5.56)]. These results underscore the urgency for robust comparative randomized research given this study is based on weaker observational evidence that is confounded by selection bias and confounded. However this was a stronger study that used statistical adjustment and propensity score matching. Thus this study suggests caution with corticosteroid and thus the importance for caution by clinicians as to the potential harms of corticosteroids in this population. These results, while based on weaker methodology, have revealed large estimates of effect, is the strongest evidence to date on treatment for ARDS, and brings us closest to the COVID-19 ARDS patient.

Subject:Suggestion Dear Mr. Fauci,
This may be way too presumptive of a note...
As an engineer I've always liked to understand the mechanics of how things work so Ilooked into educating myself about the coronavirus and it's mechanics.	CbH
I've correlated a possible research route for your organization regarding the
prevention aspect .


A quick overlook on this strategy is the following:

Coronaviruses are RNA virnses that typically enter human cells when their glycoproteins bind proteins on the cell surface. Jn the case of the virus that causes SARS, that human protein is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At this time, scientists think the novel coronavirus is similar enough to SARS that its ently point is likely ACE2 as well.

Irbesartan is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension ) and to help protect the kidneys from dam.age due to diabetes . Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks,
and kidney problems . lrbesartan belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs). It works by relaxing blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily. source:   https://www .webmd.com /drugs/2/drug-4720/irbesartan-oral/details

Idea:
Can Irbesartan, being an angiotensin receptor blocker , possibly help prevent Coronavirus infections ...
since the Coronavirus entry to humans is via ACE-2?


Ishare this suggestion with you in the hopes that it may help your department in the research to prevent the spread of the coronavirus ... or to a presumptuous email slated for deletion .

Subject:kudos and comment about JAMA Coronavirus article


Dear Tony,

  Wonderfu l articles in JAMA and NEJM. So glad you are still heading NIAID- it is comforting that there are experts of your caliber still in the room. And thrilled that the NIAID has done so much to develop
rapid timelines for DNA vaccines and that you highlighted that progress in the article, since people call me the "Mother of DNA vaccines,".

As a former NIAID Council member, I felt Ishould write to raise an issue that I am sensitized to as a
scientist who is ethnically Chinese while American:
Why in the JAMA article was it necessary to state that the first travel-related case to the US was a Chinese man (italics mine) who had visited Wuhan . Did his being Chinese either ethnically or by citizenship affect anything biologically?


 I ask because not only have many Asian people now encountered increased racism in public places (due to fear that any Asian person is a source of COVID-19), but now that the President is turning this epidemic into additional fear-mongering about "borders" it seems all the more important that scientists do not inadvertently add to "xenophobia" (even though non-white skin does not mean a person is foreign) and do not seem to advance any political perspective.

Sincerely and with best personal regards, Margaret

Subject:Fwd: Rapid Collaboration for Hand & Nasal Decontamination Formulation Dear Dr Fauci,
Dr Murad sits on our BOD and has suggested that we contact you to help expedite a rapid testing of our
product on the COVI0-19 virus . I know you are probably overwhelmed but hope you might pass this along or suggest a strategy that would be a win-win for us all.

We have developed a non-alcohol based formulation that utilizes the nanomolecule nitric oxide (NO). as you know, NO is produced in our body and is our first line of defense against microbes. We have harnessed this in a patented formulation called nitric oxide releasing solution/gel (NORGS). We are focused on the development of products for chronic sinusitis, diabetic foot wounds, warts and toenail fungus .
However, internally & personally,we have been using NORGS as an extremely effective natural hand
sanitizer and nasal spray to protect ourselve s from the common cold and flu for years .
There are strong independent published research that NO is antiviral against Corona viral species . We hae data showing definite virucidal characteristics and moderate antiviral effects in host cells.


With the recent concern with COVID-19,we felt we should try to rapidly test the hand rub and nasal spray against the COVID-19 but need to collaborate with a laboratory that could test this for us. Funding collaborators are welcome too, as this was not in our budget but we feel a social responsibility to move this forward .
I have included a short white paper of our data and a few articles to support our claims.
Feel free to contact me any time	(b) (6) ) or have one of your senior staff contact me.

Subject: Re: Urgent Email/Strategy to attack 2019-nCoV coronavirus




Dear Dr. Fauci,

Following my previous email regarding our work on developing strategies to attack the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, I am attaching in this email our experimental results demonstrating that 2 nucleotide analogues are inhibitors of the SARS-CoV polymerase. Since the SARS-CoV polymerase has over 96% similarity to the polymerase from SARS-CoV-2, we expect that the nucleotide analogues, 2 '-F,Me­ UTP and 3'-F-dTTP, will also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymera se.

At this point, it is imperative that the prodrug forms (one is Sofosbuvir that is FDA approved for HepC) of these molecules begin immediate in vitro testing with infected cells (similar to the studies carried out for Remdesivir and chloroquine in the Cell Research article at th e link, https ://www.na h1re.com/articles/s41422-020- 0282-0; PDF file of the article also attached) followed by animal testing trials ASAP. Since we do not have access to the SARS-CoV-2 viral strains, we need your assistance to identify resources at the NIH laboratories to embark on this next step

investigation ASAP. We can provide the prodrugs to the labs at NIH that you identify  for carrying  out  these  studies. In view of the worldwide  SARS-CoV-2 emergency, we'd  like your  assistance  in getting this  off the ground  ASAP.

Ican be reached any time at	(b)  (6)

Dear Drs. Fauci and Redfield,

Scientists in my laboratory at Columbia University are actively engaged in design strategies to cope with the new strain of coronav irus, 2019-nCo V, which has caused a global public health emergency. We have embarked on a project entitled "Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymera ses". We provide
a summary of this work below.

Coronaviruses  such  as the newly  discovered  virus  from Wuhan, China, 2019- nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus u se a similar viral genome replication mechanism , we reasoned  that the FDA-approved  drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir)  for the  treatment  of hepat itis C will also inhibit the
above  coronaviruses, including  2019-nCoV. To  develop  broad   spectrum  anti-viral agents,  we fmther describe  a novel  strategy to design  and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach u sed in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3'-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase
terminators.

Please let me know if you would like to receive the full manuscript.

Thank you very much for your consideration.


Sincerely,

Jingyue

Dr Fauci, you are the pre-eminent infectious disease physician in the world. I'm concerned the public has lost perspective on COVID-19. At this point, it would seem the rO and CFR are more sim ilar to rubeo la than they are to Ebol a. Can we remind the public of that? Communicating that influ enza will kill more Americans than SARS-2 hasn't gained traction. Might someone like yourself or Dr Carson communicate more strongly to the public the risks compared to other viruses they are familiar with_, like rubeola, rubella, varicella, etc?

Dear Dr. Fauci,
I understand the need for the variom stages of testing a new experimental vaccine. but in listening to you give a timeline for any new vaccine for the corona virus, it struck me that perhaps a modified approach might be considered. Why not allow early use of a vaccine that has passed a phase l safety testing, similar to what was done for the Ebola vaccines. If a vaccine is shown to be reasonably safe, why uot allow its use it in more at-risk people (elderly, smokers) before phase 2 t1ials are finished. lt could also be helpful as with the Ebo la vaccines to prevent transmission  in hot spots of community acquired infections.  There doesn't seem to be much downside compared to the potential for preventing many more deaths than was seen in the Ebola situation.
Sincerely yours,
Bill Buikema

Hi again Tony. Here's a link to a non-technical explanation of the paper 1 shared with you earlier:

hltps ://insights.som.yale.cdu/insights/new-outbreaks-of-coronavirus -can-be-halted -with-isolation -measures ­
according-to -study

I have seen  predictions  stating that upwards of 30% of the world 's popu lation will  be infected, but  I  don't see this happening. What Ido see are lots of local outbreaks from imported cases,some larger than others, but all heading towards containment. 1 find Israel to be an interesting test case. A group of infected Korean tourists who visited the country only tested positive for coronavirus after their return to Korea, joining the large outbreak that bas been reported there. The itinerary of their travel group has been made public so that retrospective ly, Israeli public health officials could ascertain who was exposed where and when (see
https : //www.health .gov.il/English/News  and Events/Spokespersons Messages!Pages /23022020  I .aspx). Already 1,600 Israelis have been quarantined on account of possible exposure. It has been twelve days since this group of tourists returned to Korea, and no new infections have been reported in lsrael associated with this group (there are two Israelis who were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and one infected while in Italy). See
https : //www .ynetnews .com/article/H IuXPa7 E8. Jt will be interesting (and impo1tant) to see how many new
infections are detected in the days ahead, and if such new infections are found among those already under preventive watch.

Nonetheless	totally concur with preparing as if major trc1mmission wi ll occur.  Much better to err by over- rather than under- preparing (a familiar perspect ive from those bygone smal lpox debates).

Finally, a reporter asked me yesterday afternoon what    wanted the President to say las\ 11ight.  Here was my
response:

In a sober way sumrnaiize the facts of the outbreak, slate that the US has an excellent preparedness team between CDC and NCH, that at the advice of this team travel restrictions and quarantine measures have already been enacted, but as of now the public is at very low risk of infection. Still, citizens should go to cdc.gov now to learn from our experts how to prepare in the event that more extreme measures are needed, stay abreast of the situation here and abroad and follow the advice of our experts, get a flu shot(!), and know that the US has a very strong public heal th system that can withstand this challenge.

Anyway.just wanted to share all this with you. Keep up the good work and good luck with the vaccine research, Ed

Tt has been many years si nce we corresponded regarding smallpox bioterrorism  and vaccination control.

   The attached paper on containing a community coronavirus outbreak from a few initial cases via  isolation and quarantine might  interest you.  The news is mostly good - isolation and quarantine can get the transmission  rate below epidemic threshold - but the key is rapid  detection of infected persons.   Also discussed are some jdeas  for alleviating congestion  in the hospital.   Ihope that you find it helpful.

Greetings,


In light of the current coronavirus situation, we would like to provide an update on your upcoming Keystone Symposia conference.

The health and safety of our meeting attendees and speakers is our top priority, and we are carefully monitoring the coronavirus situation around the world to ensure we take the necessary precautions as recommended by healthcare providers and public health organizations .

Currently, your meeting will proceed as scheduled, and we will contact you immediately if anything changes . Decisions will be made on a moment to moment basis, as new information becomes available.
We assure you that the leadership team at Keystone Symposia is closely monitoring global developments and will take swift action to ensure the health and safety of all meeting participants.

As a speaker, you hold a very special role at the meeting as a field leader. We very much appreciate your contribution to both the scientific program, and the community of luminary scientists who will convene to direct the future of the field.  Your presentation will be a highlight for many attendees, and your insights will inspire others to take on new and innovative directions in their own work. This is the essence of Keystone Symposia -- convening communities of leading scientists to inspire each other to advance biomedicine, and this would not be possible without your engagement.

We realize the current situation may add some inconveniences to travel at this time, but we also remind you that each and every one of our speakers is hand-selected by a committee of the world's leading experts to represent their field at the meeting.You are among a very select few to receive this honor.

The meeting organizers, and our team at Keystone Symposia, have put a great deal oftime and effort over the last two years into designing the program, and your presentation is a key part of that. We hope you will take these thoughts into consideration as the meeting approaches.

While this is a time we must all be vigilant about public health measures,we are reminding conference attendees that this is a lso a time to remain calm,rational and scientific in addressing the situation. We encourage you to engage with your fellow colleagues at the meeting as you normally would,to forge new collaborations and novel ideas that will drive your research and the field in innovative and fruitful directions.  At the meeting,we are providing the following suggestions based on recommendations from the National Foundation of Infectious Disease:

 The best way to prot ect yourself against COV/D-19 is similar to how you would take
pre cautions against the cold or flu . Wash your hands often using soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or the crook of your elbow rather than your hands.

 There is no need to wear a face mask if you are well and do not have symptoms- masks
protect the sick from spreading germs but wi ll not prevent you from getting sick.


 Do not assume that anyone of Asian descent is more likely to have coronavirus-d o not forget about the importance of inclusivity and evidence-based information.


Again, we thank you for your contributions and commitment to Keystone Symposia a nd wish for a very successful and inspiring meeting.

Sincerely,

Subject: invitation to speak on COVID 19 at the International ATS Conference in May Dear Dr. Fauci,
Idon't believe that we've formally  met, but I have seen you frequent ly on SSE as Iadmit patients there and often participate in the ward rounds.   I am an Al on several of Steve Hollands protocols,and   I often help with the drug-resistant TB cases.    I have been at the NIH now for over 4 years,although  I still feel like the  new guy on the block!    Most of my career has been focused  on quantifying the infectious aerosols generated by TB patients.    I am very involved  in the leadership of the American Thoracic
Society (ATS) as the Past Chair of the Assembly on Pulmonary Infections and TB. Iam writing to invite you to be a keynote speaker at a special Scientific Session being added to our International Conference May 16-20 due to the emerging pandemic of COVID-19. The exact time and data are not yet known, but the conference is relatively close in Philadelphia . This would be an opportunity to address and educate global academic leaders in pulmonary and critical medicine, infectious diseases,and public health. We usually have over 15,000 attendees at the ATS meeting. Iam attaching the email string below to give you an idea of other speakers being considered.

Ican only imagine how busy you must be now, so I apologize if this invitation is a distraction or a nuisance. And Iwould certainly understand if you are unable to join us given the demands on your time, but we would be absolutely delighted if you could speak.

Please feel to call or contact me at any time with questions or comments.

Dear Dr Fauci,




Hope this mail finds you well. We had the opportunity to meet in Madrid during the R4P meeting. I was the local chair of the Conference and had the privilege of introducing your talk to the plenary.




I would like lo invite you as plenary speaker to the meeting of the Spanish AIDS Society (GESIDA) that will take place in Malaga, Spain next 30111 November2020. GESIDA Congress is the most important HIV national meetings in Spain that brings together the full "HIV Community" including clinicians , basic researchers, experts in epidemiology and public  health and member from NGOs and patients' associations. Overall 700 attendees are expected to come to the meeting.




We would love to have you as a speaker in the Opening Plenary Session in evening the 30th November. Your challenging articles regarding the strategies to end the HIV epidemic in the United States, will be a great topic to be addressed in such session and an inspiration to Spanish researchers. If you prefer to talk abou t a different topic as the co-morbid ities scenario in HIV infection it will be welcome too.




We would be more than happy if you could participate in this meeting.



Ifknow your agenda is always full, even more these days with the current Coronavirus outbreak,

but if you could accept this invitation I think this can represent a real boost in the fight against
HIV epidemics in Spain, a field in which the Spanish AIDS Society is strongly committed .




Itwould we wonderful  if we can have you as a speaker.




Best wishes

Jose Alcami

Patricia,


David Rubenstein asked that we reach out to you in an effort to schedule an Economic Club of Washington event that would feature Dr. Fauci in a conversation with David on COVID- 19. It is my understanding that David had a similar interview with Dr. Fauci in the last week or so.

Below are several dates from David's calendar for your consideration.
Wednesday ,April 22 - Breakfast

Tuesday ,April 28- Breakfast or lunch Tuesday, May 5 - Breakfast or Lunch Friday, May 15- Lunch


Additionally, I have attached an invitation letter from Mr. Rubenstein to Dr. Fauci for your convenience. The Economic Club has the ability to turn around an event in a relatively short period of time. As you may recall, our events typically take place at breakfast, lunch or dinner, at downtown Washington, D.C. hotels. Events that feature a prominent world leader, such as Dr. Fauci, generally attract a select audience of over 500 members and guests from among Washington's business and government leaders, as well as the diplomatic corps.

We understand the complexities and constraints of Dr. Fauci's schedule and can be responsive to his needs. If none of the dates above work with Dr. Fauci's schedule, please suggest some that will and we will work with David to confirm a date and begin the process. I have copied Judi lrastorza,who I believe you have worked with in the past,and she will coordinate anything you need.

Sincerely,
Mary

Dear Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci,


I am sorry to say that our lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic has its roots in the way biomedical research is funded in the United States, as well as in the lack of leadership and vision on the part of NIH and its institutes since the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003. I try to expand on these problems in the article below. I would welcome your response to my thesis.

The Wuhan Coronavirus (COVID-19) :Why there is no cure or vaccine


In their Medical Virology text published in 1994, D.0. White and F.J. Fenner stated "No convincing evidence has yet been obtained to link human coronaviruses with serious disease ...,but they are an important cause of that trivial but annoying disease, the common cold." This generalization changed drastically with the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2002-2003 (SARS-CoV), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) immediately sought the expertise of these two scientists at the time. Now, 17 years later, we still do not have an antiviral medicine or a vaccine against the novel coronavirus that originated in China, now designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). On February 21, there were 75,567 cases and 2,239 deaths in China; and 1,152 cases outside China, with 8 deaths, according to the Director­ General of the WHO. The two viruses appear to use the same gate (or "receptor") on host cells to infect them. Despite such expected  similarities between new and old strains of the virus, research on coronaviruses has not been a priority for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In the end, all that
the Director of NIAID was able offer is "good healthcare" as a remedy for COVID- 19 infections.


The major reason we do not have a cure for  coronaviruses is that there has been no coordinated effort by the NIAID to establish long-term research programs focused  on coronaviruses . Realizing the insufficient progress in this area,
the NIAID announced on February 6 a "Notice of Special Interest to highlight the urgent need for research on the 2019 novel Coronavirus ." Grants have indeed been awarded to some scientists since 2003, but such grants are highly competitive, with success rates of applications to NIAID between 14 and 18%, indicating that 82-86% of applicants are unable to obtain funding to carry out research. The time and effort spent on preparing grant applications to NIH are enormous, diverting these precious resources from actual research to what some scientists call "grantsmanship"  (essentially, the ability to sell your idea to a review committee!). These "games scientist play" to procure funding are a hindrance to the progress of science. The fact  that we do not have a cure or a vaccine against coronaviruses over the past 17 years since the SARS epidemic, attests to this detrimental   effect.


Development of a vaccine against COVJD-19t is also not straightforward. SARS was probably not considered by NIH to be an important pathogen on which to

spend resources. Even if the biomedical research community had developed a vaccine against coronaviruses, pharmaceutical companies would probably not have considered it a profitable endeavor. Therefore, it is essential for public funds to be used by NIH and the CDC to both discover an effective vaccine and to manufacture it.


We need to ensure that long-term projects to develop antivirals and vaccines against coronaviruses and other infectious agents, including tuberculosis and influenza virus, are implemented and fully funded. We need to have a funding system that does not depend on the often unfounded criticism or whims of grant reviewers .Although the current peer review system is touted generally as the best way to allocate funding,it has never been tested scientifically against an alternative. While half of the NIH budget (currently $39 billion) may still be allocated for high-cost projects,including clinical trials,the other half should be awarded for periods of 10 years or longer to established scientists who have a
track-record of scientific work, as well as to young scientists who are starting their first independent position. The budgets of these grants would be somewhat limited, but would provide uninterrupted funding and alleviate the stress of competing for renewals every 3-5 years. Scientists opting for these grants will not have to submit extensive grant applications. More importantly, this system will more than double the number of independent investigators .After a 10-12 year period, the scientific productivity (per grant dollar) of scientists on the classical grant system would be compared with that of scientists on long-term funding. After all, the way we choose the mode of science funding should conform to the way science progresses, by experimentation and analysis .

This may be terribly simplistic, but if Covid-19 binds to ACE2 receptors in host cells, has anyone looked at ACE2 receptor blockers as potentially ameliorating disease severity or infectivity?

Tony,
As you are acutely aware, the COVID-19 situation is on everyone's mind and accordingly there have been questions raised by members of the AAAAI about what the organization can do to provide more guidance in this evolving situation . In light of this linked to the fact that our annual meeting begins March 13 in Philadelphia, we have made the decision to have a 45-60 minute session in the main hall on Saturday (March 14) morning from 7:00-8:00 prior to the scheduled plenary session slated to start at 8:15. My question is whether you would consider taking the Acela up Friday evening returning Saturday morning to host this sess ion w ith a presentation followed by a Q&A session . If that is not possible, would you be willing to provide a 10-15 minute (shorter if you deem that appropriate) video generated
as close to the 14th as possible that we would have projected in the main hall as noted above . If the latter, would you have a suggestion of an ID person in Philadelphia who would be knowledgeable and could field questions following your video. I recognize that even if you are willing to come to Philadelphia, that circumstances could arise that would preclude your traveling in which case we would ask for a video if at all possible. Finally,if neither option is possible, is there somebody in DC (including NIH), Baltimore or Philadelphia who could provide the short review and then sit for 30-45 minutes of Q&A. I am well aware that this is last minute and you have been incredibly busy with issues related to the pandemic, any help you could provide would be much appreciated by my colleagues and me. Regards,
Tom

Dear Dr. Fauci,

It is my pleasure to invite you to present at the National Academies of Sciences,Engineering, and Medicine worksho p on "The Critical Public Health Value of Vaccines -Tackling Issues of Access and Hesitancy." This workshop will be held on May 28-29, 2020 at the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) headquarte rs in Washington,DC. The statement of task for the workshop is attached.

The 1.5-day workshop will provide a venue to examine the current state of vaccine preventable diseases and the impact of vaccine access and hesitancy on vaccine preventable diseases globally, as well as the multidimensional drivers and impacts of declini ng vaccine confidence .This workshop will explore health systems, research opportunit ies, communica tion strategies, and policies that could be considered to address access, perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward vaccination. The workshop will be broadcast live over the web to an international audience, and is being hosted by the National Academies' Forum on Microbial Threats .

Due to your in-depth expertise in this field, we would like to invite you to give a plenary presentation on the development of new vaccines in the midst of an outbreak,specifically on the prospects of a coronavirus vaccine. The primary audience for the event will be researche rs, health practitioners, industry leaders,and policy makers in infectious diseases and global health, so we are looking to initiate this workshop with relevant discuss ions of barriers to accessing vaccines. Your responsibilities would be to prepare and deliver a 15-minute presentation. We would cover your travel expenses in accordance with U.S. federal government rules. We would be thankful to have your involvement in this workshop. Please let me know if you might be interested. Iwould be happy to answer any questions you may have.


Thank you in advance for your time and considerat ion. We understand that this is a very busy time and your calendar may be in flux.

Good Day: Could you please comment on this report from the New York Times that Dr. Fauci has been told that he must clear anything he plans to say about the coronavirus outbreak with the White House before he speaks to any media?

"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the country's leading experts on viruses and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, told associates that the Wh ite House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance ."

Mark:
  Thanks for the note.	If we start in April ( "'6-7 weeks from now) with a phase 1 trial of 45 subjects, it will take another 3-4 months to determine safety and some immunogenicity.  The next step is phase 2 for efficacy. We may need help with resources for the phase 2 trial if we do not get our requested budget
supplement.	I believe that we will be OK. If this goes off track, I will contact
you.	Many thanks for the offer.	Much appreciated.

Hi there,

I'm writing for Healthline about coronavirus and how the v irus spread may be differen t in the
Southern Hemisphere (they mention that in the story below). Care to weigh in?

T'd love to know:
I . Wi II coronavirus be any less severe in the Southern Hemisphere due to the summer weather there at the moment?
2. Wi II the virus spread in North  America slow down due io geography or wanner weather at all?
What can we expect in 3 months--and in one year as far as comnavirus in the U.S.?
3. Will it differ in how it spreads/tapers off in Asia, due to proximity of the outbreak?
4. Wil l this eventually be gone or w ill  it be something that is a new health  threat  that could retl1m in a year or so?
5. Any insight into the outlook of coronavirus, how  it will spread or how long it will be active?

Looking for a brief email response by Monday morning at 10 a.m. Let me know if you can assist!

Subject:Covid-19--Conference  Call Invitation


On behal f of Ms.Gopinath:


Dear Professor Fauci:


We are contacting you in the context of the evolving spread of Covid-19, which is already impacting livelihoods and economic activity in several countries .As you may know, the IMF publishes forecasts of economic growth for member countries four times a year, as well as macroeconomic policy recommendations. In that context, it would be invaluable for us to hear public health experts' views on the likely trajectory of the virus-the number of people that are likely to get infected in different countries and the likely time path.We would also benefit from hearing experts' views on the optimal public health policy response in different types of countries (countries with stronger or weaker health systems, different development levels, etc.), and the implied resource needs.

We are planning to set up a conference call with several experts to discuss these issues and were wondering if you would be available to join us. If you would be interested in joining, would you be able

to let my assistant Lucia Buono (lbuono@ imf.org)  know of some dates and times that would work for you this week or early next week?

We would be extremely grateful for any guidance you might be able to offer as we strive to do our part in helping member countries respond to the epidemic.
Best regards, Gita Gopinath

Subject: My OpEd on the WSJ coming out Friday on convalescent serum for Coronavirus


Dear Tony,


Ijust had an OpEd accepted in the WSJ proposing the use of convalescent sera to stem the coronavirus epidemic. The text of the OpEd is below in blue font (scroll down). I am sure the WSJ will shorten it and edit it but at least you have an advahce copy of it. I just wanted you to have it since the WSJ is read widely in DC and I don't want anyone blindsiding you with questions about it.

As you know I have been long proponent of passive antibody therapies in infectious diseases and there is a huge body of historical data supporting this approach. Certainly, with modern blood banking techniques this option can be made quite safe and administration of a few cc's of serum could confer immediate immunity to those who will be exposed - like ER staff.  I hope you agree with the message and like it.

Thank you for all you are doing for the country and humanity. If you need me for anything in this crisis rest assured that Iam here.

Warm regards, Arturo

OK, we'll take this and aim to get it out inFriday's paper, though it will likely need some
trimming for space.


Dear Mr. Varadarajan,

I wonder if the WSJ is interested in my OpEd. I am trying to get a message out that convalescent semm (e.g. serum from people who recover) can be used to stem the corona virus epidemic if administered to exposed people . This has been known for over a century, and is well accepted, but not widely known, even among experts today.  There was one report that China was beginning to stockpile serum but there has been almost no discussion of this option among world public health authorities.  Although I can get this published in a medical journal my hope is to publish it instead in a venue of high readership since this is something that can  be done today to stem the epidemic.  I am hoping that given the economic consequences of the outbreak that the WSJ is interested.  I included a brief bio below .  Thanks for looking at this. Arturo

RE: Single-cell RNA express ion profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan




Oh, I see what they are getting at.    They examined at the single cell level the expression of RNA for ACH2, which
is the receptor for the Coronavirus ill. the lung ,and found that when they looked at various demographic groups there was greater expression of this receptor in.Asian males.  They are thus hinting that this is the reason why there was such an explosion of infections in China. This is possible, but the lowest level was in Northern Italians and take a look at what is happening in No1them Ttaly.  Ido not mean to put the paper down since there may be some truth in
it.  However, thisjournal (b.ioRxiv) is not peer reviewed and the data are skimpy.  Someone should do a more
scholarly study.

They asked if this proved certain ethnic groups more likely to get the disease and IsaidIhad never anything like that suggested to me by our leading scientists.

Hi,


Sorry for the late response,Ijust flew back frorr	(b) (6) .


NIAD doesn't have ongoing trials with chloroquine and Iheard that such trials are being conducted in China.

W e are planning to evaluate chloroquine in animal models ASAP. If any therapeutic with a good clinical safety profile (like chloroquine) appears to be effective in vivo against COVID-19, we are planning to quickly add to them to the Remdesivir therapeutic trial as another arm.

Let me know if you have other questions. Kind regards,
Cristina

Hi Tony,


Quick question - who would you suggest is the appropriate NIH representative for this ASPR-led trans-HHS effort to coordinate COVID-19 response? You and I will be testifying in front of the House Approps Subcommittee on Wednesday morning. Would it be best for Larry to represent NIH for the ASPR gathering (though he would normally attend the House hearing), or is there someone from NIAID that would be most appropriate?

Thanks, Francis

Dear ASPR Colleagues,


We are at a critical juncture in our nation's response to COVID-19. As we pivot from containment of the virus to mitigation of its impacts, it is imperative that HHS moves swiftly, transparent ly, and in a unified manner to protect lives and save Americans. The Secretary has charged my office to lead efforts across the Department to prepare and defend our health care system during the novel coronavirus outbreak through the Health Care System Resilience Task Force.

To date, this task force has engaged with public and private sector stakeholders to broadly identify efforts that can be taken to help ensure preparedness in response to a domestic COVI0-19 outbreak, and more importantly their gaps, challenges, and potential areas of need from the federal government.  Now, we must build on that knowledge to expedite and execute a whole of HHS response to support protection of the health care system that spans public health,health care, and human services.

Please join Dr. Kevin Yeskey, ASPR's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, CDC's Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, on Wednesday, March 4 from 9:00 AM - 10:15 AM, at the O'Neill House Office Building for a working session to align current activities and next steps to be executed as part of a coordinated HHS response to COVID-19.

Please provide the following information to ASPR.HCSRTF@hhs . gov no later than Monday, March 2 at 12:00 PM, and be prepared to share and discuss at Wednesday's session.
 Your Designee(s) name, title, and contact information

 OPDIV/STAFFDIV name

 OPDIV/STAFFD IV current and future top five priorities related to COVID-19 (priority leads, descriptions, timelines)

 OPDIV/STAFFDIV key activities and workgroups (current and under consideration) related to COVID-19 response (include activity/workgroup leads, key purpose, timelines)

 OPDIV/STAFFDIV key areas of concern or challenges identified to
date

 OPDIV/STAFF DIV core competencies or other assets it can bring  to
COVI D-19 response efforts

We look forward to working with you on this critical effort to defend the nation's health care system. Thank you in advance for your support and participation.
   RespectfuIly, Bob Kadlec
ASPR

HiTony and Larry,


See below for a new Health Care Resilience Task Force being convened by ASPR.


The initial meeting overlaps with our House approps hearing. Tony, who shall we send to this one?
FC


P.S. to Tony- I'm getting a lot of buzz about the Israeli claim to have fast track vaccine:
https: //israel b.o rg/2020/02/is rael-to-have-co ronavi rus-vaccine-within-3-weeks/ It looks to me that they are conflating having something ready to put into voluntee rs for a phase 1trial, and having full scale production ready to go for the global needs. That still seems like it's a year away. Am I right?

Subject: HHS COVlD-19 Response - alignment of OPDIV/STAFDlV  Efforts



Dear ASPR Colleagues,


We are at a critical junctu re in our nation's response to COVID-19. As we pivot from containment of the virus to mitigation of its impacts, it is imperative that HHS moves swiftly, transparently, and in a unified manner to protect lives and save Americans. The Secretary has charged my office to lead efforts across the Department to prepare and defend our health care system during the novel coronavirus outbreak through the Health Care System Resilience Task Force.

To date, this task force has engaged with public and private sector stakeholders to broadly identify efforts that can be taken to help ensure preparedness in response to a domestic COVlD-19 outbreak, and more importantly their gaps, challenges, and potential areas of need from the federal government.  Now, we must build on that knowledge to expedite and execute a whole of HHS response to support protection of the health care system that spans public health, health care, and human services.

Please join Dr. Kevin Yeskey, ASPR's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, CDC's Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, on Wednesday, March 4 from 9:00 AM -10:15 AM, at the O'Neill House Office Building for a working session to align current activities and next steps to be executed as part of a coordinated HHS response to COVID-19.

Please provide the following information to ASPR .HCSRTF@hhs .gov no later than Monday, March 2 at 12:00 PM, and be prepared to share and discuss at Wednesday's session.
 Your Designee(s) name, title, and contact information

 OPDIV/STAFFD IV name

 OPDIV/STAFF DIV current and future top five priorities related to COVID-19 (priority leads, descriptions, timelines)

 OPDIV/STAFFDIV key activities and workgroups (current and under consideration) related to COVID-19 response (include activity/workgroup leads, key purpose, timelines)

 OPDIV/STAFFDIV key areas of concern or challenges identified to
date

 OPDIV/STAFF DIV core competencies or other assets it can bring  to
COVID-19 response efforts

We look forward to working with you on this critical effort to defend the nation's health care system . Thank you in advance for your support and participation.
   Respectfully, Bob Kadlec
ASPR

Morgan:
 Thanks for the note and the offer to help.  It would be great if you could tweet to your many Twitter followers that although the current risk of coronavirus  to the American public is low, the fact that there is community spread of virus in a number of countries besides China and including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran among others poses a risk that we may progress to a global pandemic of COVID-19.  If that occurs we will surely have many more cases in the USA. And so for that reason, the American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared  to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures that include social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc.  There is nothing to be done right now since there are so few cases in this country and these cases are being properly isolated, and so go about your daily business.  However, be aware that behavioral adjustments may need to be made if a pandemic occurs.
Best regards,
Tony

Dear  Dr. Anthony Fauci,



It was a great pleasure meeting you all a couple of years  ago when we were both speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Some of my contacts at the CDC recently briefed me about the rapidly emerging threat of the coronavirus to the US and have been urging us to develop an app for detecting coronavirus with high sensitivity and specificity on our Gene-RADAR
platform. Our platform has the ability to quantify viral loads in 'real-time' which would be a much more precise and accurate solution in deciding quarantine than the current thermometers or even the current CDC coronavirus test which has a very poor Limit of detection (ie low sensitivity) .

We have a strong track record of  responding to previous pandemic threats and rapidly building Gene RADAR applications for Ebola and Zika and then getting them through clinical validation as per the the FDA EUA approval process. Our Gene-RADAR Zika test was FDA EUA certified right as the Zika crisis was coming to an end.



Iwould love to work with you to see how we can help in your efforts to rapidly respondto this deadly threat to the US and the world. Here are some of the capabilities of our platform that we believe could be an enabler for helping to stop this out break from becoming a full-fledged global pandemic.

 Gene-RA DAR platform for Real time Mobile (POC) Coronavirus detection/ viral load monitoring
o Highly sensitive and specific- minimize false positives and false negatives
o With very good LOD's we could potentially start to catch people presymptomatically and enable the early detection, early quarantine would limit the spread and early intervention could lead to better outcomes
o More precise viral load monitoring could help determine when to release
people from quarantine or ICU beds
o Our platform's ability to quantify vial loads could change clinical trial endpoints for new drug candidates or (repurposed drug formulations), thereby accelerating FDA approvals for novel therapeutic regimen
o We already have an ISO 13485 certified manufactur ingfacility (currently in Boston) that we are prepared to move as fast as possible to ramp up our production
We would love to work with you to repurpose our FDA approved platform for the above coronavirus applications assay and help your noble efforts to stop this outbreak from becoming a full blown global pandemic that could costs thousands of lives and cause trillions of dollars of economic damage to the global economy.

We would love to speak with you to brief on our capabilities and discuss how we can qualify for some of the emergency funding being made available to help tackle this pandemic threat.

Happy to j ump on a phone call to discuss further how we can help

We have the following time slots open tonight:

Subject: Seeking Dr. Fauci for coronavirus webinar Patricia:
I hope you are doing well. Dr. Fauci has been a wonderfulspeaker for us in the past, and
I'm reaching out to him today for a discussion on coronavirus.


When there are major news stories, we often will try to do a live webi nar on the topic with
a leading expert or two.

This is something we would do in our studio at our office near Dupont Circle.We normally do them for 45-60 minutes, and we take questions (visa Twitter) from our audience .The audience would be reporters who cover the topic, as well as others interested in the topic . It is a way to have an in-depth, thoughtful conversation about a pressing topic.

Here are a couple we've done (the first is on Zika a few years ago):


Zika panel discussion: https://nationalpress .org/topic/understanding -the-zika­
threat/?st=O&t=&mm=Video
Ted Koppel: https: //nat i onal press.org/toolbox -topic/I ights-out-risks-to-the-power­ grid/?st=7042&mm =Vi deo
Autonomous  vehicles panel discussion:  https://nationalpress.org/topic/whats -new-with­
autonomous -vehi cles/?st =8474&t=Automat i on&mm=Story


We'd like to do one of these on coronavirus .We'd love to have Dr. Fauci as our prime guest .

We can schedule it around his demands, but would of course love to do it as soon as possible.

We know he is in demand at this moment. But he is such a singular expert on the topic we'd love to have a discussion with him - one that would help get his message out to journalists (and others) who need to be informed to best cover the topic.
Is it possible to check with Dr. Fauci to see if this is possible? Thanks,
Chris Adams

Dear Dr.Fauci,


I am writing to inquire about your willingness to address the Society of International Business Fellows (SIBF} as part of our webinar series. SIBF is a distinguished organization of nearly 1600 global executives and senior leaders. Our C-level global membership would appreciate getting your perspectives on the coronav irus outbreak.  We are open to topics which could include....What we know and don't know...As business and community leaders what SIBF members can do to prepare and educate their employees ...Safety of travel, etc.


We were thinking the webinar could be approximately 30 minutes in length (15 minutes of remarks followed by 15 minutes of Q&A}.  SIBF's Communications Manager could work with someone on your team to set-up the webinar . SIBF is a

non-profit, but we are able to provide a $2k honorarium to you or a charity of your choice.

Thank you for your gracious consideration and attention to our request . It is our
sincere hope that you w ill be able to participate.


Best regards,

Dear Nehal,


With the coronavirus bordering on a pandemic and the expectation that it will affect the US at some point,it seems to me we should be prepared to provide guidance to patients who are on immune modulators for inflammatory disease. Specifically, many will wonder if patients should stop their biologic if the virus becomes prevalent in their community. There w ill also be questions about stopping biologics in the setting of acute infection with coronavirus.

Any thoughts on this? My specific interests relates to patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis on biologics but it's also relevant to patients with IBD, RA and other inflammatory diseases.

Subject: A COVID-19 Pandemic is Inevitable. Now what?

Dear Colleague,


It's now clear that COVID-19 will become a pandemic. We don't know if it will be
mild,moderate or severe, or how many countries it will reach.


As we shift from the initiation phase of the pandemic to the acceleration stage, I've highlighted 8things we must do now in a new CNN OpEd: http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-pandemic-
frieden/index.html


Please share, and thank you for what you continue to do for public health .


All the best,

Hi Tony,


I'm sure you know Michael Milken. I've worked with him over many years, and though he is a somewhat controversial figure he has certainly helped NIH in many ways . He reached out to me last night to ask if there is anything he could do to help with the coronavirus vaccine effort. He had seen press reports that finding a pharma partner had been challenging - and wanted to volunteer his help in that regard, since he has deep connections in the private sector. He also said that he'd be glad to help with any philanthropic needs, both through his own resources and his influence over members of the Giving Pledge.

Are there useful actions that I can suggest to him?

My Name is Paul Xin, I'm a journalist from Pengpai News(ThePaper) of Shanghai, which is one of the most important new medai in China. I 'm Sorry to bother you as you must be very busy. I noticed your comment about coronavirus on American media, Ideeply hope you could answer few of my questions.Your answers will be very helpful to me. The questions are below.
Thank you very much! Sincerly,
Paul Xin



1/You said on CNN that US have had pandemic preparedness plan that developed in preparation for pandemic influenza. Could you provide some details of this plan? The plan outlines the differences between containment and mitigation. It speaks of the thing that should be done if an outbreak  occurs in the USA. Thes inclue socialdistancing, use of telecommunication and telework, temporarily closing schools, avoiding crowed places such as indoor arenas and theaters.

2/To prepare for potential communities spread of coronavirus in US, do you think that US need take the measures similar with China? China was in the "reactive" mode of responding to an explosion of cases in Wuhan City and Hubei province with spread throughout China. China had to resort to very
dramatic measures such as shutting down cities. The USA is now in a preparative mode and not a reactive mode and so our response is much different than that of China.

RE: CBS Sunday Morning



Jon:
 The message would have to be that the situation continues to evolve and people need to follow the news and the reports from CDC.  For example,a few weeks ago if you wanted to travel to Japan or South Korea, it was fine since there were few is any cases there.  Now both countries have a travel alert that says "Avoid all but essential travel". You should tell people that travel to places with few or no reported cases is fine.  Only when you have community spread (person to person to person) should you be concerned about a specific h·avel destination.  Also, you could explain to people that pandemics evolve when a new infectious disease is spreading by sustained community spread in multiple countries in different regions of the globe.  Once a pandemic erupts. it is virtually impossible for any country to be free of cases.  People need to understand that.  You can mitigate the effects, but you cannot avoid having infections since you cannot shut off the country from the rest of the world.. Also, you need to speak of the real and present danger of seasonal influenza every year.  Do not let the fear of the unknown (i .e. a pandemic of a new infectious agent) distort your evaluation of the risk of the pandemic  to you relative to the risks that you face every day. The only thing that we can do is to prepare as best as possible and do not yield to tmreasonable fear.
Best,
Tony

Hi Tony.
I have an unusual opportunity: the executive producer of CBS Sunday Morning bas asked me to do a straight to camera shpiel about COYID-19 for this Sunday. Idid something similar when people are panicking about Ebola.

You and l have spoken enough about this so that I feel comfortable with the basics. But l would love you to give some thought to whether there are any misunderstandings that you would like cleared up or infom1ation you would like disseminated.

l would love to give some logical travel advice . T know there are so many unknown s, but r have had multiple people ask me whether they should cancel their upcom ing to trip to ... you name it (ltaly, Israel, San Francisco). T know it comes down lo risk/benefit , and - as you told me during the Ebola outbreak - people have all :sorts of varying 1.evels of comfort with risk. But what do r actually SAY to the 6 million people who wil l be watching people? :)

Thanks,

I was just watching the HHS briefing online, and thinking about an article I read this morning , and Bruce Aylward 's description of what he saw in China, and a lot of videos I've watched on the South China Morning Post website (they're doing great coverage.) .

InChina, we in the med ia tend to repo1t the horrors and the lockdown and the
government's early lies...

But the truth is that a lot of average Chinese behaved incredibly heroicaJly in the face of the virus: 25,000 doctors and nurses went into Wuhan to help, knowing they might die. Average people gave  up their  stockpiles of masks  so they could be shipped to Wuhan . Neighborhood  committees brought food to thousands of little old ladies and checked on them every day, even as they asked them to stay behind  their doors for fear of infection.

Meanwhile , in America, people tend to act like selfish pigs interested only in saving
themselves. How can Ihoard a mask? Where's my vaccine? This morning, I
read  this appalling  arti cle from Alabama . Here you  have Americans  coming back from a horrifying experience overseas, and the President -- who is popular in Alabama -- asks Alabamans to take some of those fellow Americans in. There is zero risk because they're going to be housed on a naval base.

 And yet, the answer is "No!Keep them out!" And their legislators encourage it....

Idunno -- that's the kind of behavior Iexpect from my fellow New Yorkers, not
from Alabama.

Ifthe virus arrives -- and we both know it will -- America .is going to have to do better than that. Like the Chinese, Americans are going to have to look out for each other the way we haven't since 9/ 11. Or maybe since World War II .

But that's not the tone of the HHS briefings . They're an aggressive, defensive,
almost smart-alecky "we got this" tone. The only time the tone was right when you

were the third to take the mike and explain things to that kid shouting from the back without a mike about "What's the real message? What do we do?"

Maybe there could be some thought given to mentally preparing Americans to work together in the face of the crisis? Quarantines are a very aggressive approach -- but they require a lot of compassion or the people quarantined suffer.

I might get around to writing an article about this, but my editors keep grabbing me for minute by minute stuff and I'm way behind.

Hello Dr. Fauci,

Iknow you are extremely busy and will get right to the point. Iwould like to join the coronavirus taskforce.

Iworked on the Ebola task force about six years ago,which had a similar sense of urgency, and recognize that assembling a SWAT team overnight is critically important in order to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, not just for the United States, but on a worldwide basis.

I've done a significant amount of work in infectious disease vaccine development at a number of biotech firms (Vical, lnovio and lntrexon) in partnership with the NIH, Vaccine Research Center, DOD and the CDC.

Ialso	(b) (6) we discuss preparedness on a daily basis.Those conversations clearly indicate that the knowledge and expertise is severely lacking at both the academic medical center level, as well as the community health level.

I believe my assistance can be deployed in several areas where my experience in virology, immunology, antivirals , Ebola, product development and strategic partnering could be of immediate value to research scientists , medical professionals and healthcare systems.

1. Identification of emerging therapeutics.
2. Fast track emerging therapeutics from pre-clinical to IND and fast-track clinical trials.
3. Identify opportunities to accelerate the production of commercial quantities of therapeutic material.
4. Identify unique genomic fingerprints of responders and patients undergoing treatment to
guide therapeutic selection and optimize interventions.
5. Interface with public and/or institutional stakeholders on a worldwide basis (24/7) regarding safety procedures , diagnostics, therapeutic interventions, etc.
6. Other initiatives, representing areas where there is an immediate need to bring on board and deploy an individual with deep expertise, who can provide leadership, drop in and rapidly advance those initiatives.

With the urgently required, in order to provide a Navy SEAL like response, I would propose a consulting arrangement where I'm available 24/7, anywhere/anytime, for as long as needed. Please let me know your thoughts .

Here is a brief snapshot of my C.V.

The phase 1trial to determine safety for the mRNA vaccine platform

{some time in April) . However, this is just the first step in attempting to have a vaccine available for use. Even proceeding at an emergency speed, a vaccine would not be available for use for at least 1to1.5 years . It is characterized as a "vaccine".

Dear Dr Fauci,


Trust this mail finds you well.


Ihave a few questions regarding the Moderna vaccine, which it would be great to get your input on.

Is it true that trials of the possible vaccine will start in April, but that,even if the first study is positive, the vaccine might not become widely available until next year because of the need for further studies and regulatory clearances?

The company is characteriz ing this as a vaccine. Strictly speaking, what should it be
referred to as?


If you have time for a quick telephone call this morning as soon as you're able that would be great.

Many thanks, Hanna

The CDC today alerted Americans to begin to prepare for community spread of the coronavirus .....does this changes Dr. Fauci's view on the virus? If so can he join us. If this doesn't change anything. We can use what he said this morning....or if he wants to come on and talk about the new CDC warning ...we would like to speak to him.

To get 1 million deaths of 1957 would require 200 million infections at a death rate of 0.5%.  That seems high number of infections.

But what is the worldwide seasonal flu death numbers if the USA has 50,000 deaths in a bad year and the 1957 number of deaths was 116,000? The WHO says 650,000 deaths worldwide from seasonal flu. So this could be worse but by about 40% not an order of magnitude. Okay so I should be more concerned.

And do you think it will go down in late spring with warmer weather? Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D., Ph.D.

Zeke :

  Ari is a lso calling me frequently.  The virus has adapted itself very well to humans with considerable community transmission (certainly in China) now in other countries such as South Korea,Japan, Iran, Italy, etc.  If it continues to spread via multiple generations of human to human transmission, then we will not be able to avoid considerable amounts of infections and spread in the USA. Seasonal influenza has a mortality of 0.1%. The calculated mortality of COVID-19 to about 2.5
%. It is probably lower since the denominator is likely larger than we
appreciate due to asymptomatic infections . Even if the mortality goes down to 0.5%, that is still equivalent to a pandemic influenza of 1957 or 1968. In other words, it could be worse than you think.

Tony,

Ari is pestering me endlessly. What is your latest update and assessment on coronavirus? I still am having a hard time seeing this as serious as everyone else.Am I blind? Yes very transmissible but low mortality like flu in many ways-the elderly , those with comorbidities,and total impact is likely to be less than flu. Also travel restrictions are delaying but not stopping virus.

Am I missing something big or small?

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Greetings and thank you for all your outstanding scientific and policy leadership regarding the evolving Covid-19 situation.

Iam writing to you from South Korea where, as you well know, we are experiencing a very difficult phase of the epidemic. Among the several groups Ihave been engaged with to address this crisis, Iam working with the genome sequenc ing company, Macrogen, which you may already be familiar with
(https ://dna .macrogen.com/eng/). Dr. Jeongsun Seo, the Chairman of Macrogen, along with other company leaders and myself have been discussing	(b)(4

Barring the institution of any extreme travel restrictions, Iam planning to visit the Bethesda area next week (Macrogen U.S. HQ is located in Rockville). I know you are extraordinarily busy but if you (or key colleagues) have time, I and other senior Macrogen colleagues would be happy to discuss the project, its necessary next steps, along with any other matters related to Korea as you wish. [Please note that Ido not have any clinical symptoms or signs of Covid-19 nor any relevant contact history.]

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter and I hope that we may have a chance to advance
this important project together. Please take care and thanks again,

Ogan

Dr. Fauci, I trust this email finds you well. It has been a few years since we've seen one another on the Hill or at a NIAF event but hopefully we will rectify that soon.

I know you have a lot on your plate, especially with the coronavirus, but I am curious if you have five minutes for a call tomorrow so I can introduce you to my boss at BDO, Eric Jia-Soboda (https:I/www.linkedin.com/in/ eric-jia-sobota -02156036/ ). Eric is an expert in cost accounting for Life Sciences companies and he wants to glean your perspective on the likely structure of the emergency coronavirus budget request so that NIH and others can maximize those research and implementation dollars at the most rapid pace. We would certainly appreciate your time.

My best, Elv s

Hi Jason ,

Hope you have/had safe travels to DC this week ! I wanted to check in to confirm that you're still planning on coming to visit us at NIH this Friday?

Currently , Dr. Myles is holding 1Oam and Dr. Belkaid is holding 1:30pm to discuss their microbiome-related research with you. Dr. Fauci's schedule has been very fluid lately due to the coronavirus outbreak-we'll likely need to check in with his assistant Patty Conrad on Thursday to see how his Friday calendar looks (unless you hear otherwise from Patty directly).

Best,
Hillary

Sounds good - I'll ask Dr. Myles to hold 1Oam, so you can chat with him before you meet Dr. Fauci at 11. We can re-confirm timing closer to the date. I'll tag along,and can make sure you get where you need to -you'll get to visit severa l different buildings, fortunate ly all close by!

Hi Jason .

Great speaking with you last week . I wanted to follow up to let you know that Yasmine Belkaid and Ian Myles-whose work we discussed on host-microbe interactions and developing a bacteria-based treatment for eczema, respectively-are willing to meet with you on Feb. 28.

Here are links to some background info:

 Dr. Belkaid's lab page, and recent NIA ID press release about a skin microbiome study from her lab
 Dr. Myles' lab page, and NIA ID press release
about findings from a Ph 1 /2 t ri al assessing the
R. mucosa treatment for eczema
Dr. Belkaid is available at 1:30pm (her building is next to the Clinical Center, where you'll be meeting with Julie Segre I believe from 12-1ish). Dr. Myles' schedule is a bit more flexible, and he's currently available to meet either in the morning before you speak with Dr. Fauci or later in the afternoon after Dr. Belkaid (Or. Myles is in the Clinical Center, about a 5 min walk from Dr. Fauci's building) - let me know if you have a timing preference. We can firm up times a bit closer to the date, but wanted to give you an update.


Best,
Hillary

Hi Anne , Thanks a lot for your email and your suggest ions! After my last
visit to NIH
 (and meeting with Lisa Proctor and Julie Segre years ago), we did the attached story on the gut microbiome . We're very keen to look

at doing a podcast series on the microbiome (skin, gut, other anatomical bits) and how it 's informing our views on health,
disease and the way we prevent and treat diseases . It would be cool to
workshop this
theme with you and your colleagues before my visit, if you have some time?
I cut my teeth
in medical science writing on
 (bird ) flu and would be interested in the research Jeffrey Taubenber ger 's lab is doing, but my understanding (and I could
be wrong) is that there 's still a lot of work to be done in producing a universal flu

shot . If such vacc ine candidates are still years from entering clinical trials , we probab ly wou ld push that
lower down the
list .
Hope that helps , and thanks again ! Jason


Hi Jason, Ahead of your
visit , here
are a few labs that are doing innovative
work and may present interesting backgrounds to become future stories , or inform your reporting . For antimicrobial resistance specifica lly, Dr . Fauci is your best source . But
the below are
exciting areas of research at NIAID, and may be a fit for Prognosis . Let me know if any of the below pique your

interest and we can share more detail
and/or arrange
time .



Skin microbiom e:  NIAID
researche
rs developed a topical therapy for
eczema
that involves treating skin with "good" bacteria . If proven effective
, this
strategy could offer an inexpensi ve treatment that requires less frequent applicati on than many current eczema medicatio ns . A Phase 1/2 trial at NIH
indicated

that this novel therapy
is safe, and most participa nts experienc ed improveme nts in their eczema . NIH has exclusive ly licensed the technolog y  to
Forte
Bioscienc es to advance this potential new therapy through further clinical developme nt .



Gene therapy: NIAID is
developin
g and applying gene correc tio n technique
s to
treat a

variety of genetic immune
disorders
. For example, NIAID
scientist s co­ developed a lentivira
l gene therapy to treat infants with X­
SCID, a
rare and fatal genetic immune deficienc y .   In
clinical trials, the gene therapy successfu lly restored the immune systems of infants newly
diagnosed with X­ SCID, as
well as older children and young adults with the

condition who experienc ed complex medical problems after
receiving
standard therapy . Mustang Bio is handling commercia l developme nt of the lentivira l gene therapy for X­ SCID .



Flu:  Dr .
Jeffrey Taubenber ger is a 1918
influenza
expert who sequenced the 1918 pandemic viral genome using archiva l autopsy
specimens
from the Armed Forces Institute of

Pathology and
frozen lung biopsies from 1918 flu      v ictims interred in  permaf ros
t .
Learning about 1918
pandemic
flu can help us better prepare for and target future pandemic strains . Dr . Taubenber ger 's lab is developin
g  a  so­
called universa l flu vaccin e that includes
4
inactivat ed influenza v iruses and is expected to
undergo
clinical

testing soon .
Also , Dr . Matthew Memo li leads NIAID 's
influenza challenge studies
in which
healthy volunteer s are purposely exposed
to influenza in a carefully controlle d environme nt . Challenge studies offer a unique opportuni ty to ask focused questions regarding influenza virus pathogene sis and vaccine efficacy in a controlle d manner .



 Mosquitoe
s:
NIAID's

Laborator y  of Malaria and
Vector Research investiga tes disease­ transmitt ing insects and broad areas of malaria biology and pathogene sis . Dr . Tovi Lehman studies mosqui to ecology , covering broad popu latio n biology questions relevant to patterns of
malaria transmiss ion and vector control . Recently, Dr .
Lehman
and colleague s in Mali found that a single

mosqui to can
travel up to 200  mi les in
a single night with the right prevailin g wind speed . The research involved
collectin
g flying insects using sticky nets on helium ­ filled  ba lloons suspended at    vary ing heights.



Eating for the immune system: Dr . Yasmin Belkaid is
researchi ng connectio ns
be tween the    mic robiom
.:=. ,
nutrition

, fat,
and immunity . This work is early stage,
but potential ly paradigm­ shifting as she uncovers connectio ns
between
diet and immunity, with implicati ons for using nutrition to boost immune intervent ions, including vacc ines .



 RSV :
Multiple researche rs are working to develop vaccines against respirato ry
syncytial virus (RSV )­
something most

parents
have
heard of, but is not covered
by media .
RSV
usually causes mi ld
cold-like
symptoms in healthy adults ; however , RSV can be serious,
part icula
rly for infants and the elderly . It is the most common cause of bronchiol itis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 in the US. Scientist s have spent decades trying to develop
an
urgently needed safe and

effective vaccine . One candidate known as DS-Cavl developed by Dr . Barney Graham 's team at NIAID 's
Vaccine Research Center
has shown
early promise in a Phase 1 clinical trial .


I'm CCing my public affairs colleagues who liaise with these topics
in case there is follow up . Looking forward to hopefully  mee ting you when you visit . Thanks,
Anne

Re :Following up  on NIH visit


Hi Anne ,


Thanks for your email and offer to assist with other interviews .

I 'm "old school," and see merit in building relationships with researchers and hearing about their work without the
expectat ion of necessar ily getting a story .

My interests are pretty eclectic -­ from antimicrobial resistance to

anesthesia . If there 's some interesting stuff
happening that hasn 't been reported on in much detail that speaks to the future of health care (that could would for our Prognosis platform) , I 'd be keen to hea r about it .


Many thanks again and happy holida ys,

Madonna's Secret for Longevity Seen Aiding Bacteria Boom: Health
2012-05-08
21:34:07.963 GMT



By Kanoko Matsuyama and Jason Gale
May 9 (Bloomberg)
-- The secret to Madonna's staying power
may be surprisingly
simple: gardening. What the pop star does involves no trowel or soil.
Thanks
to dishes of fermented soy beans, millet and brown rice prepared by her personal chef, Mayumi Nishimura,
Madonna practices a form
of inner horticulture
-- cultivating her intestinal flora in a burgeoning alternative approach to health. Studies of the trillions of bacteria living on and in the body suggest the Material Girl, 53, may be onto something. By eating foods rich in fiber and laced with so-called good

bacteria , she may be encouraging helpful microbes to flourish in
her bowel, aiding in food digestion and vitamin extraction and
possibly staving off diseases from asthma to colon cancer.
"This diet that Madonna is following is very sensible,"
says David
Topping, chief food­ nutrition researcher at
Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Adelaide, who studied gut biology for 25 years.
"The bacteria that live inside you are fulfilling very important functions ."
While scientists try to understand the ecology of the bacteria and their interactions with diet and disease , companies
are looking for ways to profit.
The health benefits of gut germs have spawned a global market for products

that contain friendly bacteria , called probiotics, in the form of tablets or supplements added to foods
by companies including Danone, Nestle SA, and Yakult Honsha Co. The market for supplemented dairy products such as Danone's
Activia yoghurts and Yakult's fermented drinks , worth $14.7
billion six years ago, will probably expand 32 percent to $33.5
billion by 2016,
Euromonitor International estimated last month.
Quinoa, Not Coffee Studies published in
the past year have
linked certain bowel-dwelling bacteria to a stronger immune system, while others have been associated with
autism and obesity.
In one
paper published in the journal Nature, scientists showed that a
type of white blood

cell that produces antibodies only acquired
its infection-fighting ability after
spending time in the gut.
Nishimura, who has
cooked for cancer patients before being
hired by Madonna,
serves quinoa and other whole grains as
staples, along with
vegetables and soy sauce, she said in a telephone interview from New York. She also tries to offer seaweed every second day -­ usually sauteed or boiled.
"We eat food
processed as little as possible," Nishimura,
55, says of her
dietary approach, known as macrobiotic. She doesn't recommend meat, dairy and coffee. An agent for Madonna
didn't respond to a
request for comment.
Whole grains and fiber act as both food and fertilizer to the bacteria in the bowel, according to Mark Morrison, a

microbiologist with Australia's CSIRO in Brisbane studying ways
to improve gut function and health.
'Terrific Interest' There are 10 times
as many bacteria in
the human intestinal tract as there are cells in the body. As coordinator of the Human Microbiome Project, Lita Proctor is helping to organize collaboration from hundreds of scientists around
the world
trying to map and study microbial communities living on the skin ,
in the mouth and bowel, and in other parts of the body. "It's extremely heartening and healthy to have so much
attention now paid
to the diet," says Proctor, who works at the
National Human Genome Institute in Bethesda,
Maryland .
Even so, Proctor says the research is still in its infancy, and products based

on partial understanding may not deliver what they promise . "That's not holding up the industry," she says . "It's a
very fluid, ill-defined area , but with a lot of terrific
interest."
Flowers and Weeds The term probiotic
is vague and there's no accepted definition for it. Measuring results may be even more of a grey
area and some supplements are destroyed by stomach acid before
entering the gut,
according to Proctor.
Nishimura relies on fermented foods such as miso, soy sauce
and tempeh to play the role of probiotics and says the benefits
of her diet can be quickly noticed.
"I feel better than I
did 20 years ago," Madonna wrote in a preface to the cookbook her chef had published in 2010 . "I am

very grateful to you for this."
The garden analogy is helpful when it comes to describing the complex
ecology of the bacteria living on humans, says Julie Segre, the lead investigator working on the skin microbiome at
the National Human
Genome Research
Institute.
"There are some flowers that make it easier for other flowers to grow in the same soil," Segre says . The most
important thing is to
keep out the invasive weeds, she says.
'Transpoosions' When the weeds
take over,
Australian gastroenterologist Thomas Borody has a radical approach to reestablishing the balance of intestinal
flora in his patients:
he transplants fecal germs from disease-free individuals directly into the
upper reach of the colon, in a pouch

known as the cecum.
His Sydney clinic
has done 1,800 of the procedures, which
he jokingly dubs "transpoosions ," over 25 years . Borody, 62,
says the treatment has helped patients with ailments ranging
from autism to pseudomembranou s colitis , a resilient infection
that causes abdominal pain, loose bowel movements and fever.
"The next day their
diarrhea stops," the doctor says.
After the procedure, he asks patients to avoid treatments that
may damage their gut flora . Three studies presented at the
American College of Gastroenterology 's meeting in October indicate fecal
transplants can help
with bouts of diarrhea
associated with the bacterium Clostridium difficile.

When Weeds Take Over

Keeping inner bugs healthy is crucial because otherwise they risk taking over more than the garden . If intestinal bacteria aren't able to survive on the food their host consumes ,
the germs will try to
feed on what they can find -- "mucus as
well as anything
else," according to CSIRO's Topping.
That may lead to
inflammatory bowel disease, a painful condition that can evolve into colon cancer , he says. Staving off disease is one reason people have turned to
Nishimura's cooking
in the past. The chef, who prepared meals
for cancer patients
in Boston, says the diet helps with constipation, menstrual pain and body odor. When she first
changed the way she ate, Nishimura says she also found that her

allergic skin rash improved.

'So Fresh'

Typically, Nishimura tailors her meals each day to suit the way her employer feels, she says , adding that Madonna prefers
the chef herself to shop for
ingredients. Popular dishes include seaweed in miso soup; hijiki -- a type of brown seaweed -

served with carrots and onions and seasoned with soy sauce; and
cooked oats for breakfast , Nishimura says. Whole grains demand harder work for bowel bacteria, which help the body
extract vitamins and nutrients from food, because
the insoluble fiber
they contain is only broken down in the lower reaches of
the digestive tract in a fermentation process
that delivers different quantities and varieties of inflammation-

fighting short-chain fatty acids to the body's
cells.
There is "solid evidence" that microbes play a role in
tuning the immune system, says Ian Lipkin, director of the
Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia
University's
Mailman School of Public Health, where scientists showed in
January that children with autism and gastrointestinal
disturbances have a bacterial species
not found in non­ autistic
children with tummy
upsets. Madonna and others making
similar diet choices
may not know they're pushing the science frontier. They may just feel better.
"When you cut out
animal products, white sugar and coffee
for 10 days you start to feel the difference," Nishimura said. "When I first began

this diet, I remember how my head became clearer, I woke up earlier and felt so fresh in the morning that
I didn't want to stay
in bed." Madonna herself isn't lacking in
stamina . Her world tour,
which starts in Tel Aviv this month and ends next March, includes 75 concerts in Europe and North America .
Her previous
world tour was in 2008 and 2009,
when she also published six children's books and directed or produced two movies.

Hi Dr. Fauci:

lhave been a long time admirer of you in the field of modern medicine. Tbis question lhave relates to the current Corooavirus circulating around the world. For many years Ihave informed people that the ways a virus can be passed from person to person isn't always by a sneeze, cough or by toucbjng someones face with their hands. Has anyone in your medical community thought that if someone were smoking and was an infected person that once they expel the smoke particles into the air that those. micro smoke particles may contain viruses that were in the
respiratory system of an infected person. Everyone T menti on th is to don 't believe that this is poss ible. What are your thoughts on thi s matter? ff so why hasn't the medica l community warned the pubI ic about this pos ibil ity a.s T stay away  from all establishments that allow smoking on their premises.

Thank you,

Subject:Interview Request from China Dear Or. Fauci,
I'm Faye Li, jou rnalist from the Portrait, a national magazine in China. My beat is science and technology. Since the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, I'm covering feature stories about the outbreak, hoping to explain to readers what it is, especially since the virus is evolving daily at an unexpected high speed, and in so many confusing ways.

Now in China we are getting conflicting information about the new virus and thus become confused about it. For example, we are seeing more and more cases that a patient with negative test results for 2 non-continuous days, still infected with the virus and tested positive afterwards. It makes the treatment really difficult because it seems hard to determine whether the patient is fully cured or not. Since you are an experienced immunologist, I'm wondering if you could share your insights with the Chinese readers and take an interview. The Interview could be via phone or email, whichever works fine for you.

If possible, I'd love to send you the questions before we talk . Since we have time difference, Imight not be available during the early afternoon (your time) but Icould make it in the morning, noon and maybe late in the afternoon and evening (your time).

I'm sorry for bothering you on this subject, but we face severe difficulty in understanding this new virus and taking measures properly. We have quite limited sources and perspectives for understanding this new virus. However, as a science reporter, I believe in a crisis of public health, the information is the key for the public. They should have the opportunity to hear more perspectives from different specialists. Since you are experienced in fighting against so many viruses, especially SARS, Ibelieve your opinions will be inspiring to the readers.

It would be of great help and great honor for us to invite you for an interview. A phone call interview would be preferred but if time doesn't work for you, is it possible for you to reply via email? I'll list all the questions in detail.


Icould be reached by	(b)	or

C_b _<6.J., I'm looking forward to your reply.


Best wishes, Faye

Subject: RE: Call for Dr. Fauci


Hi, Kim-
i spoke to Dr. Jacobs directly.  He said that Dr. Michael Lockshin is a good friend/fellow Cornell graduate (Dr. Jacobs also noted he went to Cornell) and gave him Dr. Fauci's number.
Dr.Jacobs and Dr. Alexander Tarakhovsky, a virologist at The Rockefeller Institute, would
like to speak to Dr. Fauci about the coronavirus.  They have a theory that there may be yeast involved because it is sticky and perhaps it came from the Chinese government. They want to share their ideas and perhaps start a U.S. government effort "similar to The Manhattan Project."  They do not want funding.
I thanked Dr. Jacobs for sharing his ideas and stated that Iwould pass along the message. Should Dr. Fauci wish to speak to them, Dr. Jacobs can be reached at the number below and Dr. Tarakhovskv can be reached at	CbH
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Kara

tested positive by the CDC for COVID-19.

One individual who tested positive by the CDC had been tested positive in Japan and is already in
hospital in CA.
We are developing the following possible Courses of Action as the State of CA cannot absorb these 3
additional asymptomatic individuals	(""'

Attached for your review are draft materials to communicate NIH's preparation for potential receipt of patients with COVI0-19 to the NIH Clinical Center (timing TBD), including:

1. Rollout plan
2. All staff email
3. Statement


These materials were reviewed by Rick Davey, Ta ra Palmore, and Courtney Billet. I am developing a list of potential Qs and will work with CC and NIAID folks to develop responses, but I wanted to get these products into review in the interest of time.

It was great to know about you and your institution, for efforts in combating any emerging infectious

Iam writing this email regarding our preliminary observation about the coronav irus genome.


Iwish to share with you we have found 12 mirror DNA sequence within the genome of Coronavirus . We have named it (MRl to MR12) . we are highly interested in MR2 as this mirror DNA sequence is absent in the human genome.	(b)(4


Iwish to add here there are few studies which state that mirror DNA has the potentiality to form H-DNA and later has a potentiality to induce mutations. We strongly believe a future study on mirror DNA can answer " Why some virus mutates faster?" "Can we stop them from mutating?	(b)(4

Dear Dr. Fauci,

1got a call a few minutes ago from Veronique Nussenblatt , Chief of the Clinical Center ID Consult Service, regarding me being a part of the clinical caie team of COYID-19 patients if they come to the NIH.

She did not have any defmitive information but said there was a chance patients could be coming from California
this week-this is the first J  had heard of that, and 1'm guessing you may know more about it than 1 do.

The work wou ld include either day or night shifts, likely a couple a week. People on the clinical care team are not
instructed to separate themselves from others and will be per tested for the virus daily when working clinically.

J wanted  to ask for your OK to do this dinical work-of course I will maintain  my responsibilities  in the office
while doing so. Please let me know and happy to discuss further if you'd like.

Sincerely,
Andrea

down with me and also work with Hilary to prepare this set of cards. They should
contain all the current epi as well as the dollar numbers for the proposed supplemental budget that we are putting together- I will get asked about that and I have clearance from the department to talk about it.  Also,I want a set of cards for what we are doing in the area of research, i.e. basic research (eg animal models, etc.), diagnostics, therapeutics (remdesivir trials in China, Japan, and NebraskaL and the whole menu of vaccines . In other words, I want an entire set of cards for coronavirus. That is what I am going to get asked in both the coronavirus hearings as well as in the NIH Appropr iations hearings.

  The current appearance of community transmissions in Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran is troublesome. As l have repeatedly said over the past couple oiweeks, if and when (looks more like when now) a number of other countries besides China have sustained human to human transmissions, then we wi ll be on the brink of a pandemic,

if not already there.   The reason  to say this is that when several countries have widespread transmissions, then spill­ over to other countries is inevitable since one cannot shut out the rest of the world and so you can expect increasing world-wide transmission s among  progressively more countries.    In essence, you will be expe1iencing a pandemic. We are not quite there yet, but we are getting disturbingly close.   It will soon be a matter of semantics regarding  who would be wi lling to call it since it is not a mathematically precise definition.   I am not so sure that WHO will have the will to decl.are this a "pandemic" before a number ofrespected epidemi ologists around the world  sta1i
rcfciTin g pubI icly to it as a pandemic regardless of what WHO docs or does not declare.   WHO w ill likely be behind the curve here and wi ll wait until it is patently obvious what we are dealing with.

Dick:
  Transmission is definitely by respiratory droplet. Still unclear about aerosol transmission although there are anecdotal reports that this occurs similar to what we saw in individual episodes with SARS back in 2002-2003. Almost certainly contact transmission occurs with hand to mucosa (mouth, eyes,nasal mucosa). Unclear about fomites, doorknobs, etc. Virus can live for a couple of hours on certain inanimate obj ects. Virus definitely isolated from stool and urine, but not sure of role in transmission . No information about Transm ission to fetus . Children have very low rate of infection.  No good serologic test at this point although they are rapidly being developed .

Thanks,Tony. Please continue communication with me by email. But rest your voice for a short whlle.


Iam having trouble understanding the exact mode of transmission of COVID-19.

-Sneeze or cough produces respiratory droplet or aerosolized respiratory secretion which make contract with upper or lower respiratory mucosa, which results in infection of human cells. Seems most likely.
- What about contact transmission, contaminated hand to conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth
- Fecal/oral
- transmission to fetus
-What are the diagnostic tests to confirm diagnosis of novel coronavirus? PCR of secretions? Who in the world has these test kit; who manufactures kit.
-Are follow up serologies begin done?


Interesting questions to us and to Shelly Wolf if he were with us.


Thanks, Tony. My voice is also a little raspy.

Hi, Tony


I continue to follow the Cobid-19 epidemic .


What is the problem with your voice. It crackles like mine. I attribute mine to 'postnasal drip.'


WHO and Dr.Tedros are looking much better on TV. He has the WHO logo in the background . His tie show be tighter . His slouch is better. He still puts his elbows on the table in front of him.

Looking forward to Iunch with you .

Thank you very much for speaking to us at the 43rd Annual KAMA Convention . It was a tremendous privilege for all of us.You were also so kind to stay afterwards to take pictures with all those who asked.

To be honest, having you there was very surreal. You symbolize the best of American medicine. Igrew up idolizing your accomplishments as college and medical student. You saved and touched the lives of so many around the world. It is still hard to believe that I had this special opportunity to welcome you.

RE: Comment?




Julia:
  The appearance of community transmissions in Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran is troublesome.   As I have repeatedly said over the past couple of weeks, if and when (looks more like when now) a number of other countries besides China have sustained human to human transmissions, then we are on the brink of a pandemic, if not already there.  The reason to say this is that when severa l countries have widespread transmission, then spill-over to other countries is inevitable since one cannot shut out the rest of the world and so you can expect increasing world-wide transmissions . Hence, you will be experiencing a pandemic.  We are not quite there yet, but we are getting disturbingly close.
I hope that this is helpful.
Best, Tony

Given the developments in Singapore,Iran,Italy,and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, I'mjust wondering how your opinion about the possibility of conta inment and how fast we are approaching a pandemic has changed. Do these developments suggest we've entered a new phase in the outbreak?

If you have a few minutes to chat or email today, let me know. We'll be aiming to run a story on this today .

RE: Covid-19 question




Ted:
 Thanks for the note. Since she is 22 days out of Singapore she would be well beyond the 14 day quarantine used for people who are coming out of risk zones. And so although her risk is never zero, it is really very low.  If she were coming from Japan or South Korea, which are experiencing an emerging outbreak, I might feel a little different, but Singapore has good infection control despite the number of cases in that country   Given her history of recent Shingrix vaccination, Iwould wait another day to see if her fever breaks.  I agree that I would keep her at home for now.  I do not think it would come to that, but if you want to get testing done, it still would have to go to the CDC via the Virginia department of health. Bottom line is that Iwould sit tight for now and see how she does over the next day or so.  If things change, do not hesitate to call or e-mail me.
Best, Tony

Hi Tony,
 The wife of one of my patients received the Shingrix vaccine on Thursday 2/20 and developed fever to 101.4 the following day with malaise, headache, mild nausea (no respiratory symptoms).  She's taken ibuprofen with transient temperature reduction; the fever and symptoms are the same today.

 I've told her to keep treating the fever and symptoms but to stay at home for now. The fever after Shingrix usually resolves after 2-3 days so I'd expect it to abate today or tomorrow. My question is whether there's enough of a concern, viz. the time in Singapore, for her to be tested for covid-19. If so, what's the best way to conduct the testing? Or is it okay to see if her fever breaks by tomorrow?
(You must be getting lots of these questions).

  Dr. Fauci; Iattended a small water seminar, put on by local (Seventh Day Adventist) medical profes­ sionals, in the mid 1970's at Elms Haven,California .
 This seminar taught the participants how to eliminate the flu with the use of water treatments, ie (steam baths, etc) .
  I have now for these past 40 some-odd years, been taking two treatment's; one in the evening and another in the middle of the night, whenever I have contacted the flu: AND have had the facilities to do so; and each time Iwas well the next morning. No temperature, no symptoms whatsoe ver.
  With the high rate that this Coronavirus is spreading, one can see what a great tool these treatments can be for medical professionals.To have those who are sick with the flu, completely free of all symptoms after two treatments would greatly ease the burden on Dr's and other medical professionals AND each facility.

  Dr. I am asking for a few minutes of your time to explain this. I would like to share this with you and others. Ijust want to help by sharing what Ilearned and have been doing all these years . I feel so guilty, knowing this and not having a way to get this information to those needing it, when there so many out there sick and dying.
 Note: Ihave been trying to reach out, hoping someone will hear me.A las Ido not have the education, pedigree nor the contacts: But you Dr. have all three! Iask not that you believe in me, but that you believe in these treatments .
 Thank You for your time,please feel free to contact me via email or by phone or text or even have someone up here talk with me.
Sincerely; OB Roberts

Hi Tony,


I know how busy you are but I wanted to give you a brief update on the Annual Conference of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) based in Washington, DC. Here is the link to the overall CUGH meeting which provides an overview of the whole conference https://www.cugh2020 .org/program .  As we discussed months ago you agreed to be in the opening day plenary session on
April 13th, entitled "Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global Health Security". The details and other speakers are listed below. I may try to organize a call of all speakers in a month to coordinate talks/topics as the session is 90 minutes with 5 speakers, and a lot of ground to cover, especially with the COVID19 outbreak.


Judy Wasserheit, copied here, would also like to invite you to a special session she is organizing on the coronavirus epidemic at the same CUGH conference in a late­ breaker session on Sunday, April 19 (the second day of the conference) from 8:45am-10:15am at the Washington  Hilton Hotel (Monroe Room).  This talk would be slightly different from the plenary session and you could expand on COVID19 research priorities and update on progress.  We realize your schedule is very
busy but your insights and knowledge on both of these topics is unparalleled.  If
you cannot speak at the second session we would appreciate your
recommendation as to an alternative who could address this latter topic.


Thanks and all the best,
Tom









Plenary Session Details:


Session Day: Saturday, April 18, 2020
Session Time: 11:30am-1:00pm
Location: Washington Hilton Hotel, International Ballroom
Panel Title: "Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global Health
Security"


Short Panel Description: This Plenary Panel will highlight the continual threats of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and their impact on global security for surveillance, detection, treatment and prevention of these diseases. Over recent decades ,multiple epidemic events have underscored how highly vulnerable  we are to viral threats. Our world is globally connected-and an "emerging threat" in one part of the world can pose a threat everywhere and to everyone. About 75 percent of new human diseases are caused by microbes that originate in animals. These include HIV, influenza (including pandemic H1N1, HSNl,and H7N9), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah. The recent emergence of COVID from China clearly illustrates the magnitude,rapidity

and impact that a new infectious agent can have on global health security. This panel of leading experts will discuss the emergence of these microbial threats, and our ability to detect, respond and prevent future epidemics of these pathogens.

Subject: interview request : d raft responses for Greek newspaper


Reporter: Theodora Tsoli
Organization :Greek newspaper To VIMA (www .tovima .gr)
Phone #(s):	Cb) C6J,  thtsoli@tovima .gr
Subject: COVID-19 Deadline: Monday 2/24

The reporter emailed questions for ASF. I have drafted proposed responses for his
review, also attached.

1. Do you believe that SARS-COV2 is capable of causing a pandemic? Are you expecting many secondary transmissions of the virus outside China? A pandemic is generally defined as sustained transmission of a new pathogen in multiple regions of the world. COVID-19 does not yet meet that definition, and I hope that China and other countries in Asia with some transmission are able to contain the outbreak. However, it is possible that COVID-19 could become a
pandemic. It would not be surprising to see additional secondary transmissions of the virus outside of China.

2. Chinese authorities are reporting a decline of new cases. Could we say that the virus has peaked and maybe it will slow down? When are you expecting to have a clearer picture about the evolution of this epidemic?
Although the number of daily cases in China appears to have gone down, it is
too early to tell if this is really a decline in the outbreak.

3. Could the virus become endemic and give seasonal outbreaks?
If China is not able to contain the outbreak, it is possible COVID-19 could become endemic and lead to seasonal outbreaks. However, it is too early to know the likelihood of this scenario .

4. What about its transmissibility? Some experts say that WHO is underestimating it's transmissibility. Could the reality be different maybe because, among other things, many cases stay undetected?
Because of the many unknowns about SARS-CoV-2 , it is difficult to make any
firm conclusions regarding overall transmissibility and severity. However, it appears to be much more transmissible than SARS. Also , there are likely asymptomatic COVID-19 infections that are not getting counted because people do not go to the doctor for testing or treatment if they are not sick.

s. Do you believe that the measures taken by China and countries around the world are adequate to stop SARS-COV2 spread? There is a lot of discussion about thermal cameras and travel restrictions for example. China has taken extreme measures to control the outbreak. Restricting the movement of 50 million people is unprecedented. However, it might ultimately have an effect on slowing transmission.  Precautions implemented in the U.S. are not intended to detect every person with COVID-19 entering the country.
However, our approach has allowed us time to better plan and prepare our health
system.

6. What is the key to stop the worldwide spread of the virus?
Though we have mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop
effective countermeasures, right now, the outbreak response remains focused on the proven public health practices of identifying cases, isolating patients and tracing contacts.

7. In the northern hemisphere we have a flu outbreak - in Greece as well.
Some experts say that this is the real danger and not the coronavirus. What is your view?
Iam always concerned about influenza. Every flu season, millions of people are
at risk of getting very sick or dying. Currently people in the U.S. and most countries in the northern hemisphere are at a much higher risk of being exposed to influenza than SARS-CoV-2. However, the COVID-19 outbreak is an evolving situation and we are treating it as a very serious public health threat.

8. Many efforts are being in process for the development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus . Are you coordinating any of them and which ones? Are there any efforts more promising than others? Which platforms of vaccine development are more promising? When do you believe that we could have a vaccine available for clinical trials and then for human use?
NIAID is exploring multiple candidates and is on track to test an experimental
messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial this spring. This first phase of clinical testing will involve giving the vaccine to healthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in recipients. It is important to realize that the development of investigational vaccines and the clinical testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes time. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will likely not be widely available for more  than  a year.

9. What about therapies? Dozens are being tried - from plasma to herbal medicines in China. Which are the most promising?
NIAID is pursuing the development of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies for potential use against COVID-19. NIAID is preparing protocols for in vitro and in vivo studies of the antiviral remdesivir, which has shown promise against other coronaviruses in animal models. NIAID also plans to evaluate Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) and interferon-beta for their activity against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, NIAID scientists are working to identify monoclonal antibodies with

therapeutic potential from stored SARS patient samples as well as COVID-19
patient samples.

10. Are the things we know about this new virus more than the ones we don't know? Which are the main questions about it that remain to be answered? New data are published about SARS-CoV-2 every day. However, we still have a lot to learn. For example, we do not know why there are so few cases among children, which is uncommon for a respiratory virus.

11. How worried should people outside China be about SARS-COV2? What is the biggest danger from this virus?
.The risk to the general American public remains low at this time ; however,this
could change and that is why we are treating the emergence of a novel coronavirus as a very serious public health threat. We understand that people may be worried. We ask that people not let fear or panic guide their actions_

12. Which are the protective measures anyone should take against the new virus? Do masks work?
The vast majority of people outside of China do not need to wear a mask. A
mask is more appropriate for someone who is infected than for people trying to protect against infection.

HHS Engages Sanofi's Recombinant Technology for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Vaccine
Racing to develop a vaccine against the 2019 novel coronavirus, the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response has engaged Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi.
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of
ASPR, will provide expertise and reallocated funds to support the vaccine's development . Sanofi will use its egg-free, recombinant DNA platform to produce a recombinant 2019 novel coronavirus vaccine candidate.
The technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins of the virus .The protein's DNA will be combined with DNA from a virus harmless to humans, and used to rapidly produce large quantities of antigen which stimulate the immune system to protect against the virus.The antigens will be separated and collected from these cells and purified to create working stocks of vaccine for advanced development .
"Flexibility and scalability are cornerstones of rapid response to an emerging infectious disease," said BARDA Director Rick A . Bright, Ph.D. "Using this proven technology, we can pivot immediately to address this new global health threat. Our goal is a licensed vaccine to provide long-term health security against this latest virus and prevent future coronavirus outbreaks ."
BARDA has worked with Sanofi since 2004 and in 2009 began collaborating with Protein Sciences of Meridian, Connecticut, now owned by Sanofi, to develop a recombinant technology with the flexibility to make millions of doses of vaccine quickly in an influenza pandemic. In 2016, BARDA added this vaccine to the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile. When Sanofi purchased the company and its technology in 2017, BARDA continued working with Sanofi on pandemic vaccine development, and in December 2019 the partners began focusing on increasing manufacturing capacity for recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States, in accordance with a presidential executi ve order to enhance national security and the public health by modernizing influenza vaccines and technologies .
This expanded collaboration with Sanofi is BARDA's second program to focus on developing a novel coronavirus vaccine candidate in the past few weeks. There is currently no approved vaccine, treatment, or diagnostic for novel coronavirus infections; however,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to enable emergency use of a diagnostic test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
BARDA also is working with counterparts across the government, including within HHS and with the Department of Defense. The team is reviewing potential vaccines, treatments and diagnostics from across the public and private sectors, particularly products in development for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), to identify promising candidates for development and licensure to detect, protect against or treat novel coronavirus infections.
To obtain information about any potential products in development in the private sector
that could be used in responding to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. government

launched a single point-of-entry website for innovators and product developers to submit brief descriptions of their diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other products or technologies relevant to this new virus.
Federal agencies are particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that have progressed into or beyond non-clinical studies, have established large-scale commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing capability, and/or have utilized a platform already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). BARDA also opened an easy broad agency announcement, an EZ-BAA,specific to diagnostics that utilize platforms already cleared by the FDA, with a viable plan to meet requirements for the FDA to consider Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) within 12 weeks of an award.

Dr. Fauci,


We wanted to send a quick note to thank you for join ing us today. Your discussion with David was so interesting and well received.

The coronavirus alone was on the minds of so many CEOs as it impacts their supply chain.


David, it goes without saying that you are the best interviewer! You make everything substantive and
entertaining.


Wishing everyone an enjoyable weekend! Warmest regards,

Dr. Fauci,

Infants and children infected with CoVid-19 seem to be an anomaly. Could it be as simple as childhood vaccinations? Are Chinese children vaccinated with anti malarial drugs such as Chloroquine phosphate, which is proving effective in older patients for CoVid-19?

Jf infants and cltildren are not getting severe infections, why?

Dear Ors Wu, Brooks, Barie,and Fauci:


It is more than incredibly impressive at how all of you, in just the past few days, have rearranged your schedules and agreed to participate in this special session in only about 2 weeks .We are all very grateful, and know this will be tremendously impactful for the CROI audience.

Below is the final list of presentations, although the order and titles may well change.  We are hoping to have a conference call with the session liaisons and speakers next week if possible, to go over each of the talks to address the overall plan and discuss any overlap . Shortly we will send out a poll for availability for early morning in China, early-mid afternoon in the US West Coast,and late afternoon­ evening in the US East Coast.  If you can respond to the poll by Monday we would greatly appreciate it; things are moving quickly.

Tony, my condominium community has es1ablished a program in which prominent members of the Washington area are invited to make presentations on subjects of great public interest. Shown in the emai l below is a description of this program. In this regard Ihave been asked to contact you to see, recognizing your incredibly busy schedule, if you would be interested and able to provide an update on the Coronavir us situa tion to our residents. Most likely you

A few weeks ago	(b)(6) spoke to a sold out crowd on impeachment.  We've featured authors on avariety of topics; invited doctors w ith specialties of interest to our community organized trips to the Kennedy Center and theaters for attendance at ballets and plays and sponsored visits, led by experts, to various museums and the Library of Congress to view special exhibitions.  An example of the latter is a tour of the Folger Library		(b) (6).   A
presentation by Dr. Fauci on the coronavirus would be of great interest to our constituency who keep infom1ed by reading both national and international journal s. We are flexible on th e date for such an appearance needing only a few days' notice to inform our residents .

is a virologist .


we have been following the corona virus pandemic closely, and a few days ago became alarmed at the news that the chinese government  is sterilizing their paper money from hubei province.

we think that there is a possibility that the virus was released from a lab in wuhan, the
biotech area of china. we also think that the virus might be complexed with another organism,such as a yeast or fungus, to make it more sticky.

we would like to discuss this with you further. we feel that immediate action must be taken by united states scientists to try to neutralize this threat.

Dear D. Fauci,
Iwant to suggest that NIAID arrange to collect serum samples from Coronavirus patients who have survived a major infection and probably have genera ted antiviral antibodies. My laboratory showed in the attached papers that such antibodies could be cloned from sera using a powerful technology called Phage Disp lay. The project could be initiated in this country with as few as 2 patients.

Dear David Morens, dear Anthony  Fauci,

l realise it is not an influenza  virus, but the outlook of your 2007 paper ("The 1918 Influenza Pandemic: Insights for the 21st Century") seems to me to be very valid for the cuJTent coronavirus outbreak. Or put differently - your statements and concerns from then mostly coincide with my thinking and wonies now... :( .

So a question - what is your thinking now? Are the hospitals you're affiliated with hiring additional staff(yet)? Any personal preparations?

Good luck to you and all the best for those dose to you, kind regards, Sean Scherer


P.S. I guess part of the the reason I'm asking is, because I (a non-institutionally affiliated biologist), am in touch with the university-hospital here	(b) (6)Germany), but my concerns are so far falling on deaf ears... But also just reading the paper and seeing others come to the same conclusions - albeit on more theoretical grounds and multiple years ago - made me want to reach out. Plus T guess I'm simply curious about what you think !

I hesitate to speak definitively for him and his schedu ler, but to be perfectly honest I think it's really unlikelythat1d he'd be able to accept a speaking invite for Denver. The schedule is insane for the foreseeable future and isn't letting up on the weekends. He's turning invitations down left and right,unfortunately - especially those involving travel!

Hi Courtney,


I hope you're doing well despite the ongoing craziness whether it's coronavirus or
politics. Yikes, these are unsettled times.


I have a quick question for you. Our annua l meeting is May 14 - 17 in Denver. Many of the sessions are in place but there's talk about doing a session around

coronavirus and inviting Dr. Fauci as the speaker. The meeting is a Thursday through Sunday and they're looking at inviting him to speak potentially on Sunday morning. Is this something he would even consider and would he commit this far out given everything that's going on? Any quick thoughts you might have would be helpful.

Thank you, thank you! Have a great weekend. Stephanie

Hi Tony,


Igot asked by Alex Keenan what the NIH needs for the coronavirus response. I said that this had been looked at with great care by you and your staff. If you are asking me for technical assistance, I said, we need about	0>)(5Jfor FY20-21, and more in the long run.

ASFR was in the room but did not have a visible seizure.


Just thought you'd want to know before you meet with the staffers later today.

Dear Dr Fauci:


We've had a lot of discussion a round our COVID-19 session today. An idea that came up was possibly having you do something remotely. Either a live feed in from your off ice at approximately 1:05 PM to 1:20 PM EDT on Tuesday, March 10 if you have that time available, or have you send in a video recorded presentation a day or 2 before that we can show at the session.Having some way to communicate the

high priority NIH/NIAID has on developing a vaccine and treatment would help bring the content together.

We know this is likely not possible, with the very short notice and your even more tremendously busy schedule around all of this. But it's worth the ask.

Please let me know if you think either of these is possible. And Patty, sorry for butchering your email address earlier.

Best, Donna

Subject:RE: CROI COVID 19 Session; Tuesday March 10 lunch Dear Dr Fauci:
As I mentioned on the phone, we just today decided that we will have a special session on COVID 19 at CROI. It will be on Tuesday,March 10, during the lunch break; the initial general structure will be a 10- to 15- minute overview (CDC), a 25-min talk by Ralph Barac (UNC) about the virology of coronaviruses, and a 10- to 15-minute summary on what NIAID/NIH is doing and planning. We thought that this being

one of the first large medical conferences in infectious diseases this year, that we address COVID 19 at CROI

We know that this is terribly last minute, but the CROI Chairs and Foundation are hoping you are free to
give the NIAID/NIH update. CROI is in Boston, March 8 to 11.


If you think you would be able to do this, we will send a more formal communication with details and
work with Patty on the specifics . Thank you so much Dr Fauci; we hope you will be able to join us. Best,

Now that I've had a chance to read the whole story -- after editors finished whirling --1 see it also
contains these grafs : Are they accurate? Thanks


During one call, the CDC's principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, argued against taking the infected Americans on the plane, according to two participants. She noted the
U.S . government had already told passengers they would not be evacuated with anyone
who was infected or showed symptoms. She was also concerned about infection control. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who was also on the calls, recalled saying her points were valid and should be considered. But Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the coronavirus task force, pushed back: Officials had already prepared the plane to handle passengers who might develop symptoms on the Jong flight, he argued. The 1:\vo Boeing 747s had 18 seats cordoned off with 10-foot-high plastic on all four sides. Infectious disease doctors would also be onboard.

The Washington Post has just put up a story saying that the 14 infected passengers on the buses containing 238 American passengers from the Diamond Princess were flown home AGAINST the CDC's advice. And that the States Department overruled the CDC on this.

Can you confirm whether that's true?


Tha nks... Donald



Story contains these crucial grafs:



In Washington, where it was still Sunday afternoon, a fierce debate broke out: The State Department and a top Trump administration health official wanted to forge ahead . The infected passengers had no symptoms and could be segregated on the plane in a plastic-lined enclosure. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disagreed, contending they could still spread the virus. The CDC believed the 14 should not be flown back with uninfected passengers.
"It was like the worst nightmare," said a senior U.S. official involved
in the decision, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations . "Quite frankly, the alternative could have
been pulling grandma out in the pouring rain, and that would have been bad, too."

RE: quick question: when does an epidemic become a "pandemic " officially?




It is impossible to predict at this point if the current out break will progress to a true pandemic .  The future of this outbreak and whether it will progress to a pandemic will be determined by two factors: 1) the degree to which China controls infections in China,which will ultimately impact how many infections leak out to other countries in the world .2) The success or not of other countries
that have received travel-related cases from China in preventing the development
of sustained transmission of infections in their own country.	If these other countries are successful in containing the transmissions, then a pandemic will be avoided . If a large number of countries are unsuccessful in preventing sustained multi-generation transmissions ,then we could witness the next pandemic .

ICAUTION : EXTERNAL SENDER 	


Joel:
  There are many iterations of the definition of a "pandemic" . However,one that I use that is simple and understandable is as follows:  An outbreak of a serious infectious disease with substantial global health consequences (usually one that has never before been experienced by the human population) that is transmitted readily from person to person and where there is sustained transmission (i.e. multiple generations of person to person to person) in multiple countries and regions of the world. In this regard, the coronavirus outbreak in China is an "epidemic" in China, but it is not yet a pandemic since there is not "sustained" person to person transmission throughout the world.	There are infections in other countries (more than 25 countries), but these started as travel related cases from China and although there are several human to human infections in these other countries, these infections have not yet been "sustained".	If we start seeing sustained, multiple generations of transmissions in many countries throughout the world, then the outbreak will have progressed to fill the criteria of a true pandemic.
Hope that this is helpful.
Best regards, Tony

Dear Tony Fauci:
Hi! Busy times. Hope you are well. Can you explain to me how we will know if and when covid-19 has become pandemic, versus whatever you'd call the current situation? Just in general, what's the definition of a pandemic?
Thank you...best, Joel

     Meanwhile, on the other side of the earth, there have been 73,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 2000 deaths. This leaves American health experts hoping that the number of infections has been dramatically underreported .
     That is not a typo. If the current nu1nbers are close to accurate, it indicates a coronavirus mortality rate upwards of 2 percent. The morality rate for the seasonable flu is generally .1 percent .The mortality rate for pandemic flu is .3 percent. The particularly deadly flu pandemic of 1918 -

which took the lives of more than 100 million people around the world - had a mortality rate of i.8 to 2 percent.
So, if 2000 deaths is the numerator, scientists hope that the
denominator is actually much larger. And that is probable, given the likelihood that there are many more people who have the infection but don't know it, or are not showing symptoms.
     The good news? The outbreak started in a single location and seems largely contained there. There have been several hundred cases in more
than 25 countries outside of China. But the overwhelming majority have been travel related. The containment measures of Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan - which have the most cases - seem to have been successful. Of the 15American cases (before the arrival of the cruise ship passengers), 13 are travel related. The two others are spouses of people in that group. We still have not seen widespread, sustained transmission from person to person outside of China.
     The Chinese reaction to the virus has shown the weaknesses and advantages of authoritarianism. The immediate response of a system built on fear is to a problem like this one is denial and deception. No one wants to carry bad news. So local Chinese officials spent the first week of the
outbreak - as the disease was spreading under the radar - insisting that the transmission of the virus was all animal to human.
But only in a society like China could you have the effective lockdown
of 50 million people, including the entire city of Wuhan, to slow the spread of the disease. Public health officials in most places -who are required to balance health needs with civil liberties -would not even consider such a measure. Yet it appears to be working.
     The danger? "All that is needed is for a few countries in the developing world that can't contain the coronavirus," Tony Fauci told me. "This could be the second wave of the pandemic."
Pandemic diseases tend to attack the weakest links - the most
vulnerable health systems - in the global chain. If there is sustained transmission in those places, says Fauci, "even countries with best practices will suffer." Countries in Africa are of particular concern. There are millions of Chinese in Africa, and many Africans study in China. Countries such as Ethiopia, Senegal and South Africa seem to be doing a good job at testing random samples for coronavirus in key cities. But Liberia? Guinea? Sierra Leone?
     Seldom has there been a stronger argument for American global engagement to strengthen African health systems, which constitute part of
own immune system against pandemics. Seldom has there been a better

argument to abandon "America First" posturing and to recognize that our own fate is closely tied to the fate of other nations.
Much about the future course of the disease depends on the answer to
a scientific question: Is someone who has the virus but lacks symptoms - or
has symptoms so mild they hardly notice - capable of transmitting the
virus to others? "It looks like the answer is yes," says Fauci. Which would
make the virus far harder to control.
"We may find that the virus is highly transmissible, but less lethal
than we thought in the beginning, " Fauci told me. In this case, the danger
would be similar to a particularly bad influenza. And the outbreaks could be seasonal, like the flu as well. "I would not be surprised if that happened, " Fauci concluded.

Dear Dr Fauci,
 Thanks so much for being who you are and for dedicating your life to protecting all of us. I write because I saw your interview on PBS tonight and had a question pertaining to denominators and numerators. Please know that I profess absolutely no expertise in areas pertaining to biology nor medicine nor disease and while I understood and agree with your esti1nation that the fatality rate of the Corona virus to date may be som.ewhat inflated of the number of cases is understated , I have a related

question for you regarding info I was able to find at this site https://www .worldomete rs.info/coronav irus/
Regarding data  this site reports, among many things, and as
one scrolls down, that the 'number of active cases' reported today is 57,228 and the number of these that are 'serious or critical' is 12,064. In a worst case scenario, and taking the 12,064 as the numerator and dividing it by a denominator of 57,228, we get 21.08, or about 21%, much higher that the 1%
based on total deaths over total cases so far. Of course this is not
fair but my question is this :  can we know better how many of the patients (cases) who are 'serious or critical' and still being treated will recover?
Thanks much for any reply-
Alan DiCara, Winsted, CT

David:
  Thanks for the note.   I hope that all is well with you.   Although allogeneic/semi­ allogeneic blood transfus ions could be an interesting approach to serious COVID- 19 disease,there are a number of existing drugs such as remdesivir (nucleotide analogue) and Kaletra (protease inhibitor) that have some pre-clinical activity against the virus and these are now being tested in randomized clinical trials.
Best regards,
Tony

Subject: CoronaVirus Epidemic -- a Thought

Dear Tony,


It has been some time since we last spoke, but this current catastrophe has provoked my thinking about possible therapeutic interventions that could be immediately employed -- in advance of therapies/vaccines that will take

many months to create. AndIneed to share those thoughts with you.


My suggestion is to treat actively-infected, and acutely ill, patients (under carefully controlled procedures) with allogeneic/ semi-allogeneic blood transfusions.	The resulting GVHD response should theoretically combat, and eradicate the viral infection.
Ilook forward to your thoughts on this suggestion.


With best wishes to you and your family, David

Dear Dr. Fauci,


I hope all is well. BioCentury is doing a roundup of companies and institutions developing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to treat patients with COVID-19. Since you told my colleague Steve Usdin NIAID is developing its own mAbs against the virus, we'd like to include information about that program in our roundup.

Would you  or one of your colleagues be able to answer the following questions? Any information you could share by 5 PM Pacific Time on Thursday, Feb. 20 would be greatly appreciated.

1. Are your mAb candidates being developed against specific targets on SARS-CoV-2? If so, what are those targets?

2. What platforms or processes are you using to identify mAb candidates?


3. Do you have multiple mAb programs against SARS-CoV-2 proceeding in parallel, and if so,how are they distinguished?


4. What is that status of each of your mAb programs? For example, have you nominated any lead candidates, are you awaiting patient samples, etc.?

5. Do you have any metrics on lead candidates available yet, such as neutralization titers? If so, what are they?

All the best, Karen

Have you had a chance to discuss this world bank conference? You, Cliff and Libby received invites. As Gray has mentioned, this is a pledging conference, so we will need to be prepared to address funding (the person that attends would need to be in sync with you on that).
Obviously Cliff is on travel. Who would you like to have at the conference, if anyone?

Dear Dr. Fauci,


On behalf of the World Bank health team, in coordination with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI),it is our pleasure to invite you to a half-day consultation on Financing Coronavirus Disease 2019 {COVID-19} Vaccine Development. The meeting is set to take place on Thursday, February 20,2020 from 9:30am to 1:30pm at the World Bank Offices in Washington DC (located at 1818 H St NW) on floor C2,conference room MC C2-12S.

As you know, the novel Coronavirus outbreak, which started in Wuhan, China, is evolving rapidly. As of today, the number of confirmed cases has increased significantly to over 60,000 and the virus has reached 25 countries. The outbreak, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), poses a threat to countries worldwide, especially those with weak health systems and low levels of pandemic preparedness .

It is of urgent importance that we move quickly to finance the development of the appropr iate countermeasures for a disease that risks becoming endem ic across the globe.Two critical issues are necessary to address: i) immediate financing for the development and scale-up of a diversified portfolio of vaccines, and ii) financing the manufacturing and procurement of vaccine for global distribution.

To enhance our discussions we are working on a background paper which we will share along with an agenda at the earliest. Recognizing the short notice, we will provide remote connection details for those unable to travel for the meeting. A working lunch will also be provided.

We hope that you will be able to participate in this important meeting. Kindly confirm your participation to Ms. Gabrielle Williams, Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice, World Bank (wbhealthevents@worldbank.org ). Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.


looking forward to your positive response .


Best regards, Feng Zhao

Subject; Potential Speaking Engagement: Winter 2021

Dear Dr Fauci


I know things must be impossibly busy right now with the current coronavirus issues but wanted to
touch base to see whether you may be interested in a speaking engagement next Spring as part of our
(b)(6)



A bit about me: Iam a	(b) (6)Air Force Major General and retired SES from the Department of Defense.
(b)(6)
                            is an associate professor emeritus from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at the George Washington University. We are both longtime admirers.

              consists of people drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds, including doctors, lawyers and many from the senior tiers of the finance and corporate worlds up to and including former CEOs and other executives (and even a few retired senior government folks like me). It is an active, well-rea.d and learned community with a keen interest in current events. As an example, we have a very active Foreign Policy Association chapter that always draws folks from across the spectrum of political and policy perspectives for interesting and well-informed discussions.


Our	(b)(    speaker series consists of presentations on a vast array of subjects, from literature and art to current events and public policy issues. Typically held on Tuesdays nights from December through April, these sessions consist of a presentation of an hour or so followed by Q&A and general discussion. We always draw standing room only crowds .


Recent and upcoming speakers have included:

The recent coronavirus outbreak has captured the interest of the nation and the world.  Our folks would be extremely interested in how organizations such as NIH respond and address these incredible challenges.  A presentation by you about your work on these issues, from your groundbreaking work on AIDS onward or any other topic of your choosing, would be absolutely the height of our season.

We pay transportation, lodging, an honorarium, and could even arrange for a round of golf at one of our outstanding golf courses! (Of equal importance is that we can offer you a brief respite from the cold of winter.). There are direct flights from Washington DC to West Palm Beach. We have openings in January, February and March 2021.

We would be deeply appreciative of your favorable consideration. Please feel free to contact me if Ican answer any questions

it's morning edition from n. p. r. news on david green in culver city califomia and a militant in washington  d. c. good morning in china the death toll from the corona virus has hit two thousand world leaders in public health officials are trying to contain it but new infections keep showing up earl golden for example he was a passenger on the diamond princess that's the cruise ship where hundreds of people got the virus we took an aquatic clues to also alone what went wrong who knew we were going and the crew and beautiful omar here's how he ended up in omaha earl his wife jerry
were quarantined on that ship for twelve days in a felt fine the whole time but then the gun on a flight back to the u. s. and earl started feeling sick or wind burke from japan to this day about two hours into the flight they woke up with a high fever after napping a little bit and the doctors on board confirmed the and then on the flight landed he tested positive for the coronavirus he's recovering now in a bio contain mean unit at the university of nebraska's medical center he's going to have to spend fourteen days there and isolation well you know working %hesitation %hesitation catering we've heard on a but one of the two days of the different doctors each day i





didn't have a clue but got a little cough still you can you might want to debate left me and i'm a little to keep but maybe also because of the jet lag in the travels and everything else on top of it no it doesn't feel any different than you know recuperating from a regular coal earl's wave jerry hasn't been diagnosed with the virus is she's being monitored in a different part of the hospital but their case is a good example of some things we know and some things we don't know about how this virus is spreading so we have called doctor anthony fauci he's director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases good morning sir good morning so earl coleman was fine all those days on the ship then he gets on a plane and he gets a fever what does that tell us about how this virus is spreading well the virus has the ability to bind it to certain cells in your body particularly in your long so you can get anything from miles a symptomatic illness to a cough and a fever to some people about oh about twenty percent of the people come to the attention of medical than physicians in health care providers can get serious pneumonias requiring intensive care it sounds like this individual is on the %hesitation mild side of the illness because as he said it doesn't feel much more than just a common cold and as a matter of fact corona viruses in general prior to this all one of the causes of the common cold okay so what does that tell us i mean bleary often looking at the cases
we're looking at a rising death toll which is tragic we look much less at the people like
early say you know my voice is raspy a had a fever had a cough the years a wide range of stuff symptoms with this virus did do do we know why some people seem to be doing okay and other people are getting hit really hard well whether a couple things about that for the first thing is that any any kind of viral infection or any pathogen infection there's always a wide range of responses in the sense almost like a bill shaped curve some people get no sim is at all and we do have a symptomatic corona virus infection with this particular episode and then there's the bulk of people who get some sort of symptoms and then a small percentage of people do really really very poorly now that relates to the ability of the body to handle the virus and the one thing we know when it's not unique to this virus is that the elderly those with underlying conditions like chronic heart disease lung disease diabetes obesity they tend to get more complications much more than for example and otherwise healthy individual and that's the reason why if you look at the death rate which is around two percent for this disease at this time it is disproportionately high are among the elderly and particularly those who have underlying conditions this is interesting question carlin is wave terry presumably they work together the entire time they were quarantined right and if he gets the virus she does not did she just get lucky do some people have some sort of immune undefended don't it's a combination that's a good question it's a combination of both there is no virus that has one hundred percent attack rate even the most of infectious of all viruses like measles doesn't get a hundred percent of of %hesitation vulnerable people but respiratory viruses particularly things like influenza or the corona virus the attack rate is burying percentage and it was if he was really likely that his wife i don't think she necessarily had any on the line immune protection though that's possible the maybe some cross reaction of immune protection with other %hesitation microbes that she came into contact with but in most likely is as you suggest the luck of the draw okay interesting





and they got to patching wondered if you could clear something up because we've been hearing reports about so called super spread ours these you who spread the virus to a very high a number of other people and it sounds like a scary thing but and ijust under is this a real phenomenon there that there are people who give the virus to more people than most and why is that happening well it is certainly the phenomenon of the super spreading israel we story with sars back in two thousand two and two thousand in three and they're episodes already with this particular new corona virus and it's a combination of two things it's an individual whose either at a particular moment in time shedding a very large amount of virus which makes it much easier to infect a group of people who are around him but you also see it sometimes in the hospital setting when you have a number of health care providers taking care of someone and that person is shedding a lot of virus so the short
answer to your question is there are super spread is and it's a real phenomenon
okay okay what we would you say at this moment is the most important or the most pressing question about this virus that we don't have answers to yet well what we don't know for sure we know that there are people who are infected will without symptoms or very minimal symptoms they hardly notice they're infected well we don't know is the extent to which people who have no symptoms are spreading it so we do know that this can occur because we have anecdotal documented cases of people who do not have symptoms who actually have infected someone usually a family member but we don't know the extent to which this cars in the broad component of this outbreak doctor anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases sir thanks for joining us it was a pleasure to be with you

 Your hypothesis is certainly possible, but Ithink unlikely. In a NEJM paper for which I have just written an editorial, there were 400+ patients and none younger than 15 years old. I am certain that children from birth to 15 years were exposed to and primed by coronaviruses multiple times and so if 2nd infection enhancement were an important issue, we should have seen it in children and adolescents 15 years old and younger. Just a thought, but anything is possible. Best,

Good morning, Tony,
I woke up thinking this: given the relative sparing of young people during the COVID-19 outbreak, could something similar to what happens with dengue be going on? Could a second coronavirus infection - albeit with a genetically different variant than the first - bring about worse disease than the first? And, since up to a third of the common cold is caused by a variant of coronavirus, could older people somehow have been primed by an earlier coronavirus infection?

(resending with Patty's correct email address)


Dear Dr Fauci:


As Imentioned on the phone, we just today decided that we will have a special session on COVID-19 at CROI. It will be on Tuesday, March 10, during the lunch break; the initial general structure will be a 10- to 15- minute overview of the epidemic (CDC), a 25-min talk by Ralph Barac (UNC) about the virology of coronaviruses, and a 10- to 15-minute summary on what NIAID/NIH is doing and planning.  We thought that this being one of the first large medical conferences in infectious diseases this year, that it is important that we address COVID 19 at CROI.

We know that this is terribly last minute, but the CROI Chairs and Foundation are hoping you are free to give the NIAID/NIH update. CROI is in Boston, March 8 to 11.

If you think you would be able to do this, we will send a more formal communication with details and work with Patty on the specifics . Thank you so much Dr Fauci; we hope you will be able to join us.

Best, Donna

Subject: ACTION: Invitation to Provide Opening Remarks atthe NIH-AACR Cancer, Autoimmunity, and
Immunology Conference on March 23rd (on the NIH campus)

Dear Dr. Fauci ,

It's pretty clear that you have been ridiculously busy over the past month+ serving as our nation's top infectious disease doctor! Thanks so much for your leadership and dedication, Dr. Fauci!

I'm actually reaching out to you on a topic other than the coronavirus, as I am writing on behalf of the co-chairs for an important NIH-American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) conference (the NIH-AACR  Cancer, Autoimmunity, and Immunology  Conference) that will be taking place on March 23-24, 2020, on the NIH campus (in the Masur Auditorium  in the NIH Clinical Center).


The co-chairs would  like to invite you to be the opening speaker on Monday, March 23rd_   Dr.
Sharpless will be the opening speaker on Tuesday, March 24th_ Please see the attached draft
agenda.


Now in its third year, the Cancer, Autoimmunity , and Immunology Conference focuses on: 1) understanding the biology of immune-related adverse events which have occurred in cancer patients treated with immunotberapies and how that might inform the study of autoimmune disease, and 2) defining the potential for the study of autoimmune disease to lead to greater understanding of the treahnent and management of immune-related adverse events during and following cancer therapies. The goal of this interdiscip linary conference is to bring together people who migh t not typically interact to promote cross-fertilization for tbe betterment of both research and clinical care, which is why there are four N	Cs very much involved in the Conference, including: NCI, NIAID, NIAMS, and NIDDK.

Chairing this effort on behalf of the AACR is Julie R. Brahmer , MD, Johns Hopkins Univer sity. From the NIH, we have Elad Sharon, MD, MPH, NCI ; Ravi Madan, MD, NCI ; Connie Sommers, PhD, NCI; Howard Young, PhD, NCI; Katarzyna Bourcier, PhD, NCI; Marie Mancini , PhD, N1AMS; Annette Rothennel, PhD, NIAID ; and Lisa Spain,PhD, N1DDK.

I know the diverse audience, including patients , researchers , clinicians, industry, regulators, and others, would be thrilled by your presence. Of comse, we also know that you have pa1ticipated in the previous two conference on this topic, which underscores why they would love to have you participate again!

Please let us know at your earliest convenience if you are interested and able to pa rticipate in the conference on Monday, March 23rd. ff you have additional questions or concerns, you can contact me at jon .retzlaff@aacr.org or	CbH6l

Thanks again, Dr. Fauci, and I look forward to hearing from you !

NBC online asked, "What is NIAID's position on whether the SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in
asymptomatic people?"


Iwould propose that we send a response to Jacqueline attributed to ASF:


Early case reports indicate in certain circumstances SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in asymptomatic people. We do not know the extent to which asymptomatic transmission is impacting the outbreak. However, we know that people with symptoms are usually the main driver of outbreaks of other respiratory diseases.

From scientific perspective,  it is very satisfying to see that both the papers using completely different approaches arrived at the same virion capture model. That was not anticipated when we initiated the work 5-years ago because the reasons to develop these assays were very different.	have mentioned to Emerman to consider highlighting the papers in the journal issue, and that you and Jim might be will ing tom write a short piece but	have not heard about this.

Dear Dr. Anthony Fauci,



I'm Bernice

(b)(.6..l..


I had read your online discussion details on USA Today which says:
"Another thing that we don't know is why, with a respiratory-borne  illness,are there virtually no children getting infected. Imean, there are no cases of kids less than 15 years old. Does that mean for some strange reason they're not getting infected, or the illness is so mild in children that we're not noticing it? It's very clear the median age is 56 or 59."

Ithought it would be crucial to share updates on Singapore's coronavirus situation for your reference, because you are the expert who could help analyze the current situation. Till date, in Singapore  H6>have two young children who are infected:

ONE YEAR OLD
"Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. Advertisement  He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH." Quoted from https://www .channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19 - coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176

SIX-MONTH OLD
"COUPLE, BABY AND MAID INFECTED The 28-year-old mother - whose infection was announced on Tuesday - works at Yong Thai Hang, a health product shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists.  Her husband, a 45-year-old Singaporean tested positive on Wednesday at about 2pm, and is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) . Both have no recent travel history to China. The couple's child, a six-month-old boy, tested positive at the same time and is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital. The family's domestic helper was one of the confirmed cases on Tuesday.  MOH said in an update on Thursday that the child

was not in any infant care facility and was cared for at home,prior to being admitted to the hospital." -

Colin:
 Thanks for the note. The number 44 is in flux. When I checked a couple of days ago, the "officia l public" number was 44. However, it was clear that there was likely more than that since the results  of the tests were still coming back on some individuals.   And so, it is a minimum of 44 infected from the cruise ship, but it is uncertain how many more than 44 are infected. I do not know where the Americans are staying

Iam a dermatologist but also a clinical researcher and scientist .
Iwas reading all of the news regarding concerns and questions on how the fellow patients are being
infected.


A few questions arose, based on the NIH data on SARS Coronavirus,that has been much more studied, and most likely less viru lent than the current COVID 19, which supposedly has HIV traits as well as traits to increase transmission.

I have wondered if COVID-19 is like Legionella, and possibly transmitted in the airborne water droplets
in the air conditioning units of the Diamond Princess ship.


Even with the SARS Coronavirus, it was shown to be infective on fomites for up to 28 days unless 40 degrees Celsius and 80% humidity, when it was then inactivated in a few hours (see the attached article).  I am wondering if the trays of food, after being passed to passengers on the ships, were then washed in suboptimal conditions (NOT at 40 degrees Celsium for several hours at 80% humidity)

IAM concerned,that based on the reinfection of those in Wuhan, China, after they returned home, on whether 14 days of quarantine is enough, based on the modeling and studies on the SARS Coronavirus, and whether 28 days of quarantine may actually be needed.

With the HIV virus component of COVID 19, one must also wonder if the T cells are being infected and passing the infection along within an infected patient. In the U.S., we may need to beware of blood transfusions from anyone infected, even asymptomatically, with COVID 19.

Iam sure that you have teams of clinicians and scientists working on this, and I don't know if any of the original scientists working on the SARS models are still around at Chapel Hill to perform these related studies and modeling.

Subject: New Eng land Journal of Medicine Editorial Dear Dr. Fauci,
I am delighted that you have agreed to write a signed editorial to accompany the article on the initial estimates of
key transmission parameters associated  with nCoV-2019  virus by Li et al.

The general purpose of the Journal's editorials is to provide the reader with an authoritative interpretation or elaboration based on the substance oftbe article. Since this substance is usually not within the average reader's special competence, such readers will particularly benefit if the editorial avoids technical jargon,  explains the article's contribution  to a field of knowledge, and emphasizes, whenever possible, its clinical implications. The editorial commentary should not be concerned exclusively with the article in question but rather should use the article as a starting point for a more general discussion.

Because editorials involve interpretation  and opinion, you and your potential  coauthor must be free of significant

relevant financial associations (including equity interest, regular consultancies, or major research support) with a company, or with a competing company, that stands to gain from the use of a product discussed in the editorial. Please contact me immediately if you are considering a coauthor. so T can ensure that your candidate meets our criteria. Additional information about disclosure of financial and other associations appears below this letter.

Please bear in mind that your editorial represent s your (and any coauthor's) personal opinion. The Journal does not include statements of grant or other support or acknowledgments with editorials.

Hi Dr . Fauci : I'm working on a story about WHO DG Tedros and the work that he 's doing to contain the coronav irus epidem ic . I 'm planning on discus sing a number of themes, including that responding to outbreaks has become the mos t visible job of the
DG in the past couple of decades . I'd also like to explore the issue of how important it is that countries be as open as     po ssible about disease outbreaks, and that it's the DG 's job to encourage that and mov e countries toward greater transparency and participation	in battling outbreaks .

All : Below is an outline of question::; for tom orrow at CFR. Sorry to get th is to you late but ii seems the news
changes everyday. As you wiJl see I focus mostly on coronavirus as I suspect that's where the interest will be but get
to bio weapons toward the end.

This ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVID-19 , outbreak has a number of historic firsts. It's the largest quarantine in world history with China locking down over 60 million people. It's the first mass repatriation of American citizens into a quarantine, climbing over 1,000.

Let's start with some quick basics: what  is coronavirus? How contagious? What is the morbidity  rate?

How does it compare to SARs and MERs? More/less infectious? Lethal?

Just to put this in perspective every year here in the US we deal with the flu. How many Americans on average die each year from the flu?

But as I mentioned coronavirus has resulted in a munber of historic firsts, talk about what you expect could be our scientific firsts and what roadblocks do those scientific firsts confront?


Over the years, global economic interdependence has grown in nearly every industrial sector, including health care. But that means our health care is also globally interdependent on other systems less equipped, less transparent and perhaps less responsible global actors.

China closed the wet market where the coronavirus outbreak began on 1/ 1, gene sequenced the virus on 119 so they could develop a diagnostic test but did not share the gene sequence with the global health community until l/12.

How transparent and quick was the Chinese response? What should the have done that they failed to do? What were the consequences?

China now claims more than 70K infected and almost 1800 deaths from the virus. But ft bas been widely reported that the Chinese have underreported both numbers . what are Countries international obligations to report accurately? To whom? How do you know the numbers are accurate?

How does the current outbreak impact the domestic medical supply chain? What steps could or should we consider to enhance supply chain resilience?

What do the numbers suggest to you about what to expect regionally and worldwide? Have numbers peaked? Will they continue to iise? With the cruise ship there re now a total of 15 Americans infected. Do you expect additional cases? What scale? How prepared are we nationally? Locally?






Looking back over the roughly past decade, emerging infectious diseases played a recurring ominous theme. Be it from I-IlNl, to ebola, then Zika, and now the 2019 novel coronavirus, the threat is clearly not dissipating.  When it comes to non-disease natural disasters , the Stafford Act provides a Disaster Relief Fund to enable immediate response. By comparison, there is a small Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. Do we need a more Stafford Act-like mechanism to enable quicker response and research to these new threats? What other actions can we take to better prepare?


While often we see folks painting emerging infectious diseases and biodefense into separate categories, the truth is that there is significant crossover in terms of preparedness and research. Understanding that thi s is a sensitive topic, could you talk about how we should approach these risks in a comprehensive manner that can achieve public health and national security objectives concurrently?

I'd like to use this to transition to the topic of bio weapons which is what we originally planned to talk about. The landscape here has also transformed. When BioShield was w1itten and the Strategic National Stockpile established we worried about State actors deploying banned weapons like small pox; plague and hemorrhagic fever. And you

still must prepare against those things as well as new and emerging threats like the toxins we have seen deployed by Russia and North Korea in more targeted assassinations.

How do you stay ahead of these threats? Do we have the resources and surveillance that we need to stay ahead of the
threat? And ensure the necessary vaccines and therapeutics?

The ebola outbreak may be an instructive example, it seems to be coming under some control despite the precarious security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo .  But the ongoing 2018 outbreak was the second largest in history following the 2013-2016 West African outbreak.  As a result of these outbreaks, the United States government bas pioneered new FDA-approved diagnostics and vaccines, with promising therapeutics seemingly around the approval comer too.  \Vhat lessons can we draw from the ebola outbreaks? How do you work with and incentivize industry to develop what you need in the event of a catastrophic bio attack? And How do you make the best possible decisions about the stockpile?

I always worried that because we are global leaders if there was a bio attack or outbreak anywhere in the world, others wou ld look to us and to our stockpile for the answer. Are our global allies doing enough to prepare against these threats--whether they be manmade or natural?  Are they maintaining adequate stockpi les of medical countermeasures and research bases--and should they be?

Lastly (if we have time) ....the FBI recently arrested a Harvard scientist for accepting undisclosed  grant money from China for scientific research . It has now been reported that there are similar investigations at a number of US universities including Yale and MlT to name two and that the grant monies are in the billions. What are foreign governments looking for? Why in the US? Clear ly a national security risk , is it a bio weapons concern?

Dear Dr. Fauci,
lt is with trepidation that l reach out to you with information that has been shared with me regarding the real status  of the Coronavirus in China. My information comes to me from a	(b) (6) who has correspondence from a nurse in Harbin, China.

Cb_>_<.6,l. is here on an Hl V visa, employed for the past several years at
the internationa l student program· ------------------------------ 
1have no reason to doubt LJ1e authenticity of the correspondence that she shared with me.

This correspondence shows a lung X-ray, a glass container of bloody fluid removed from an infected lung, and a map of Harbin, China depicting many areas of the coronavirus outbreaks. The written correspondence reveals that the numbers being released of confirmed deaths is drastically low due to the spread being too fast to test. Deaths in hospital hallway s and of medica l sta:ff is not being shared in order to prevent pan ic.

Protective gear is unavai lable and the nurse w1iting the correspondence is fearful for her life. She sta.tes that there
are five levels of screenings (tests?) before a person is reported as testing positive or of being infected with the virus.
Ifsomeone dies before being confirmed, these suspected deaths are covered up and not reported. Reported numbers,
even of confim1ed cases are grossly 11ndercounted.

I figure you and our government realize the infonnation and numbers coming out of China are highly inaccurate, but this correspondence on	(b) (  confim1s it. I felt it was only ethical and moral to report this, despite
 	C_b>_ C_6J, plea that the two people involved in the correspondence fear governmental retribution if it was
discovered  that they discussed or passed on this confidential  information .

11·eport this and swear it to be true and confidential. 1am trnsting it will help in some way and not just stir panic.

ps - feel free to contact me at this address, or my personal email address, that is
(b) (6).


again, I have no dog in this fight aside from wanting to avoid a large scale pandemic worldwide .


And I'm sincerely hoping that we throw the rulebook out - and develop a new one - to deal with this the
same way we did when we dealt with the 1918-1919 pandemic.


On Mon, Feb 17, 2020 at 10:09 AM Ed Peshko <esp@hedviginc . com> wrote: Dr. Fauci,
Like you, I've been watching the COVID-19 outbreak with great alarm. Given the current data, I'm almost positive at this point that it will hit the US hard at some point and as a student of history that terrifies me.

So I'm hoping that your department has contacted the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and see if you could make the following idea national or international. It is a supplemental health system based on Al and mobile technology and consists of two planks:

First:

  - train an Al to be able to detect COVID-19 by measurements that can be done by cell phone (for example pictures of patients, recordings of patient's respiratory system)

Second:


- develop and release a  smart-phone application that does the following:


- turns on location tracking so health authorities can see where the cell phone owner is.
- allows for people to upload health measurements from their cell phone.
- keeps TRACK of where the cell phone owner is. If that person then tests positive for COVID later
on, it can then automatically figure out all the contacts of that person for the last 14 days.
- notifies those contacts that they have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, to isolate
themselves and regularly test themselves.


The goal would be to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from descending on hospitals and overwhelming them, and to allow for the CDC or other medical personnel to go OUT and get them - or isolate them for treatment in their own homes - rather than having them come in and infect everybody.

Now this all hinges on the idea that Al could detect COVID-19 based on an audio recording or a simple picture and do it reliably, but I'm fairly sure that it can based of the peer-reviewed literature. It is not
a difficult Al problem assuming that the microphone can pick up sounds well enough - if not, there are already integrated stethoscopes for cell phones that could be mass produced - and once developed
to enough precision it could be deployed nationally or internationally fairly easily.


For all I know something like this is already in the works but Ihaven't heard of anything like it - apart from the chinese app which AFAICT does not use any Al but DOES allow for automatic contact tracing.

I sincerely hope this is already in the works . Ultimately it could be used both for detection and treatment - assuming the current antivirals work out they could be distributed to the same coordinates that positive diagnoses come in, perhaps by cheap drone so that nobody actually needs to be exposed to the virus to effect treatment.

Anyways, thanks for your time and efforts. Personally I'm a software developer but I'm hoping that perspective his helpful - for Iview the fight against this virus as an INFORMATIONAL fight. It's like a fire-suppression system or food safety measures. Again, I have no clue whether or not this is already being done, and Iapologize in advance if I'm missing something and this all seems obvious.

I just think that in this case it is prudent for us to be safe rather than sorry. Thanks much,

supplementation of influenza surveillance system for COVID-19 outbreak .


Dr. Fauci,


Like you, I've been watching the COVID-19 outbreak with great alarm.Given the current data, I'm almost positive at this point that it will hit the US hard at some point and as a student of history that terrifies me.

So I'm hoping that your department has contacted the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and see if you could make the following idea national or international. It is a supplemental health system based on Al and mobile technology and consists of two planks:

First:


  - train an Al to be able to detect COVID-19 by measurements that can be done by cell phone (for example pictures of patients, recordings of patient's respiratory system)

Second:


- develop and release a  smart-phone application that does the following:


    - turns on location tracking so health authorities can see where the cell phone owner is.
- allows for people to upload health measurements from their cell phone.
    - keeps TRACK of where the cell phone owner is. If that person then tests positive for COVID later on, it can then automatically figure out all the contacts of that person for the last 14 days.
    - notifies those contacts that they have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, to isolate themselves and regularly test themselves.

The goal would be to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from descending on hospitals and overwhelming them, and to allow for the CDC or other medical personnel to go OUT and get them - or isolate them for treatment in their own homes - rather than having them come in and infect everybody.

Now this all hinges on the idea that Al could detect COVID-19 based on an audio recording or a simple picture and do it reliably, but I'm fairly sure that it can based of the peer-reviewed literature. It is not a difficult Al problem assuming that the microphone can pick up sounds well enough - if not, there are already integrated stethoscopes for cell phones that could be mass produced - and once developed to enough precision it could be deployed nationally or internationally fairly easily.

For all I know something like this is already in the works but I haven't heard of anything like it - apart from the chinese app which AFAICT does not use any Al but DOES allow for automatic contact tracing.

Isincerely hope this is already in the works. Ultimately it could be used both for detection and treatment - assuming the current antivirals work out they could be distributed to the same coordinates that positive diagnoses come in, perhaps by cheap drone so that nobody actually needs to be exposed to the virus to effect treatment.

Anyways, thanks for your time and efforts. Personally I'm a software developer but I'm hoping that perspective his helpful - for I view the fight against this virus as an INFORMATIONAL fight. It's like a fire­ suppression system or food safety measures. Again, I have no clue whether or not this is already being done, and Iapologize in advance if I'm missing something and this all seems obvious.

Ijust think that in this case it is prudent for us to be safe rather than sorry.


Thanks much, Ed

Dr. Fauci,
Might you be available to update our viewers on the latest developments in the coronavirus story today/tonight? We are particularly interested in getting your evaluation of the passengers who have been released from two cruise ships. The first, in Yokohama, Japan, where over 300 Americans released from the ship have now arrived back in the US,to go into 14 days of quarantine. 14 of those people tested positive at some point after leaving the ship, but before they boarded the plane. The second ship we want to focus on is in Cambodia. Something in the neighborhood of 1,000 passengers released from that ship have been reported to be in some state of travel to their homes, presumably around the globe. One woman who made it as far as Malaysia tested positive there and is hospitalized in Kuala Lumpur. We do know that the CDC is working with WHO and the cruise ship line to track down those traveling people.

We would very much like to hear from you what level of concern we should have over those many hundreds of people traveling right now, how well quarantine works, how important it is to maintain it, etc. We would also like to touch on the methods of containment and treatment being done inside China and how well those methods have worked.

I realize it is a holiday, and that could complicate things. But please let me know whether you could
consider this, Doctor, and we will begin to work out the logistics. Thank you.
Very best regards,
Dave

I was with someone who's a diplomat with the Australian government who said "it's much, much worse than the Chinese would have you believe. Much worse." Melbourne and Sydney were deserted almost immediately of Chinese tourists and students. I luckily flew through DOHA.

Hang in there . It's always something.

I hope this note finds you well and that you've gotten a little rest over the weekend, during what I'm sure is an inordinately busy time. Would you be able to elaborate on the measures taken to keep the 14 US evacuees who have coronavirus from infecting others on board the plane? I know that remdesivir, under compassionate use, was given to at least the first Amer ican coronavirus patient, and last week NIH researchers published results early that it had preventive effects for macaques exposed to MERS.
Has the US considered using this drug to protect those exposed to but not yet infected with
coronavirus?

to 2.2.  Also, the situation is as we have discussed on several occasions.   ln the USA, the travel restrictions seem to be working with only 15 cases in the USA (13 travel and 2 spouses).   But, as I have said, this could change.  Ifwe get substantial sustained transmission in a number of countries throughout the world , including the developing  world, then sooner or later there will be sign ificant lea kage of infected individuals into tb e USA since you cannot restrict incoming travel from the whole world.  The way we might be able to avoid a real global pandemic is if the non-China  countries can contain  the infections in their respective countries before there is widely distributed  sustained transmissions.   Once widely distributed sustained transmissions happen , a global  pandemic  is inevitable. What would a global pandemic mean?    It <lepends on the true rates of morbidity   and mortality.   The currently reported mortality of COVID-19 is about 2%.   However, there are several folds more cases than are coming to the official attention of hea lth autho1ities, i.e. asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections.    If you count these, the denominator gets much  larger and the case fatality rate could drop to 1% of even 0.5 % or less.   If that is the  case, then this could be a very severe seasonal flu (0.2% to 0.4%; regular seasonal 11u is 0.1%) or a typical pandemic like 1957 or 1968 (0.5% -0.9 %).  We are not sure where it is going to land.
Hope this is helpful.
Best,
Tony

Hi. Tony,
J thought you would be interested to see a text (below my email) I ju st got from a very smart Wall Street guy who has been filling me in on reaction there. I've been doing my best on air to put the current situation in perspective - communicating that the risk in the U.S. is still relatively low whi le letting viewers know the situation is fluid and could change. How would you sum up where we are now?
Thanks,
Jon

Do you remember the cases of viral pneumonia due 10 measles that take place in African infants in the late seventies.

Many sorry to bother you. Have a goodjob!

Hi there,

Please see below. HHS is taking over the Partnership for Public Service IG account next week for Public Service Recognition Week. They asked if Dr. Fauci would be willing to do a short 30-second or less pre­ recorded video thanking public servants for their wo rk. It would be featured during the takeover , and also on NIH's other sm handles next week . It can be taken on a cell phone as sm does not require higher resolution. Let me know if you would like to accept or decline the request.

Many thanks,
Kim

Hello All,


Hope everyone is holding up well!


OHR is taking over the Partnership for Public Service (PPS) lnstagram account during Public Service Recognition Week (May 3-9, 2020). The OHR team has reached out about wanting to develop a senior leader "mashup" video -perhaps including the DepSec. T


They asked about the feasibility of this request. They also inquired about perhaps Dr. Fauci and
the SG doing a pre-recorded video thanking public servants for their work.


Iwanted to gather the troops so we can identify what all is being planned for this week of
recognition and provide a POC for OHR if the request is feasible. Happy to set up a call, if that is needed to discuss further .
Thanks,
J anell

Hi Dr. Fauci,


Please find attached for your review a draft press release to announce the launch of the ACTI 2
COVID-19 treatment trial (remdesivir and baricitinib) . Below is your draft quote:


      "We now have solid data showing that remdesivir diminishes to a  modest degree the time to recovery for people hospitalized with COVID-19," said NlAlD Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. "ACTT 2 will examine if adding an anti-inflamma tory agent to the remdesivir regimen can provide addition al benefit for patients, including improv ing mortality outcomes."


The trial may start enrollment tomorrow.

Thanks much, Kathy

Summary
We have developed an analysis pipeline to facilitate real-time mutation tracking in SARS-CoV-2, focusing initially on the Spike (S} protein because it mediates infection of human cells and is the target of most vaccine strategies and antibody-based therapeutics .To date we have identified fourteen mutations in Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence
of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling. The mutation Spike 0614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. These finding have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions.

John,

Ithought you should know that the D614G story is getting a lot of press attention today. Istory came out in the LA Times this morning that probably started it all. It will likely be on CNN tonight, and maybe other networks.

Just a heads-up. David

Subject: Re: Dr. Anthony Fauci & Avi Schiffman/The Webby Awards HI Courtney,
This would be a pre-recorded message with Dr Fauci solo. He would set up Avi's award and help to celebrate his Webby moment for him. Avi will be sending us his 5 word Webby speech which will then follow Dr. Fauci's intro. Below is a draft of the introduction for him, let us know if he would like to make any edits/changes. I've also attached the format for taping on his phone/computer. Please let me know if you need any additional information and hoping we can make it work.

Thank you so much Best

DR. FAUCI:


I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci. Unfortunately, you've seen a lot of me lately. But thankfully, I'm here to present some good news and I'm excited for the opportunity to shine some light on one of the many young people who have stepped up and helped us throughout a difficult time.

The 24th Annual Webby Awards would like to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Person of the Year to recognize his creation of ncov2019.live to track the spread of COVID-19 across the world.

As we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVID-19, including the difficult, but critical calls for nationwide social distancing, the Internet has become the lifeblood of people looking for accurate information about the novel coronavirus and the necessary steps to combat it.

Since launching the site on December 29th, Schiffmann's tracking tool has been an invaluable resource that sounded the alarm on the virus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity long before many global officials.

At a time when the spread of misinformation can be so detrimental to our efforts, the site has provided over 600 million visitors with accurate real-time data. Schiffmann has helped people around the globe understand COVID-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and the importance of measures to flatten the curve.

For having the foresight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating an essential website to provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere,it is my great privilege to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Webby Person of the Year.

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Ihope you and the family are all safe and healthy during these challenging times. Hailed by The New York Times as "the Internet's highest honor," The Webby Awards has been the premiere award for online excellence for over two decades, honoring the companies and people who have critically shaped digital technology and culture.

This year, due to the impact of the coronavirus The Web by Awards are moving their renowned award show to an online experience . On May 19th,2020, the 24th Annual Webby Awards will bring togetherWebby Winners from around the world in an Internet Celebration which will showcase the artists,

organizat ions, and creators using their platforms to imagine a better tomorrow through information, education, movement, comedy, all while inspiring audiences to take action to enact positive change.

The 24th Annual Webby Awards are proud to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Person of the Year to recognize his creation of ncov2019.live to track the spread of COVID-19 across the world. We would be honored if Dr.Fauci would "virtually" present Avi with his award.

As we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVID-19 on the world and late calls for nation-wide socialdistancing,the Internet has become the lifeblood for people looking for accurate information about the novel coronavirus.Since
launching the site on December 29th,AviSchiffmann' s tracking site was a necessary tool that sounded the alarm on the novel coronavirus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity long before many global officials.By providing over 100 million visitors with real-time data on the virus' spread, Schiffmann has helped people around the globe understand COVID-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and measures to flatten the curve.

For having the foresight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating a website to provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere,it is our great privilege to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Wehby Person of the Year. The celebration will highlight the important work Avi and his
fellow winners are doing,and will mark his hallmark Wehby 5- Word acceptance speech in Internet history.  Dr. Fauci's presenter speech could be recorded on his phone and we can send you through a script for him to review, edit and details for format and deadline.

This year's Webby Awards will also take action,the impact of COVID-19 and government responses around the world, has brought the importance of voting into sharp focus .The Webby Awards has partnered with Vote.or and aim to check the voter registration status of 1million voters in the United States, promoting the importance of vot ing to help ensure voter turnout this November is the highest it has ever been.This partnership will integrate into all elements of this year's online celebration.

Our thoughts are with all of you in this difficult time. Best

Dear - highly respected - Dr. Fauci


Why do Itry to childishly support a respected expert and personally
highly honored Gentleman like you - Dr. Fauxi?


Because for me - it is heartbreaking and unbelievably disturbing, what was and is going on in the course of the last 4 months in the USA.


Italk about the USA, that relieved my country - AUSTRIA - 75 years ago from the hell of the NAZI-Regime - with American Lifes and Blood.


With all my respect, my hopes, my passion, my tears, my mourning -
May Grace and Blessing be with You and the USA.






After running the numbers available on COVID 19 pandemic data - my experiences as an Economist led to following analysis and proposed strategy:

COVID 19 is a true threat for humans >65 years of age with pre­ existing illnesses,
but nearly influenza-like for humans< 65 years of age and humans >
65 years of age without pre-existing illnesses

2. Minimize possible contact with virus for people older than 60 without pre-existing illnesses

Once 1 and 2 are warranted:


3. Handle the rest of the population with care, but keep them going and working - as you would do in an influenza-season The critical factor for further intervention is the ca pacity of the regionally availa ble ICU-ca pacity

Dr. Fauci,

Ihope this email finds you well. Iam a professor at the University   of Maryland, an elected term member in the Council on Foreign Relations, and a former fellow at the Supreme Court of the United States.

Iam writing becauseIam preparing a book, tentatively entitled "Rebuilding America: A Blueprint for Post-COVID-19 America," consisting of essays by leading figures on (1) how COVID-19 has impacted their particular field, and (2) how that field should be reimagined in light of the crisis. The essays will recon sider all sectors of society, including law, education, healthcare, fashion, music, etc., and collectively will be the first comprehensive guide for post-coronavirus  reconstruction efforts.

1am very hopeful that you may be willing to contribute a short essay on how the current coronavirus has impacted public health policy , and how such policies can and should evolve moving forward.

Only 50 industry leaders are being asked to contribute.  Commitments
have been secured from an impressive group, including a retired
four-star general and a preeminent constitutional scholar. I very much hope you will take part in this innovative project given your historic and unparalleled contributions to the public's understanding of the current crisis.

With respect to logistics, I am hoping to receive commitments from all authors th is month, with essays due within one month, and with the

essays available through Amazon's expedited publishing platfonn roughly one month after that.  Each essay should be no more than 1,000 words, and I may offer light edits for the author's final approva l.  A
final note: all proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated.


I am very hopeful that you  will  give every serious consideration  to this invitation, and will lend your voice towards reimagining and revitalizing a new America.

Dear Zhu,
The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat not only to global public health but also to economic and political stability.Uncertainty about the origin of COVID-19 pandemic is causing friction worldw ide, particularly between China and the United States. There is agreement that the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 originated in a bat. There is also a high level of confidence that the virus was not deliberately modified in any laboratory . What we do not know is the answers to two questions :(1) whether a precursor virus circulated in the human population before it evolved to become a pandemic virus and (	whether a recursor virus

Subject: CORONA and BACTERIAL SU PER INFECTION



Dear Doctors,




Idon't know if you have got this infomation.







A truly deadly virus

cannot spread very far . Why? Because people quickly get sick and die. In other words, they cannot spread the virus further, which is a prerequisite for a large spread like corona. Covid-19 has spread throughout the world.




The premise is that it is not very dangerous, it causes mild symptoms for most people, many do not even notice that they were sick. But the virus has different phases in the body, after a while it goes into a resting phase, you fee l better, but the virus is still present and can pass on. Covid-19 is an optimally developed virus that spreads rapidly around the world. But if it were really deadly, almost everyone would die.



So far in our 4 billion long history, there have been no airborne viruses or bacteria. Yes, in the hollywood movie "outbreak" there was, but it was a movie. Why hasn't it?




If it had existed, this planet would have been a dead planet without life. It would have killed all living. It is possible that there is somewhere else in the universe, but not here on planet Earth. Not now. Remember, this is not the first time a new virus is spreading in the world. What is happening now has happened earlier in our long history.




But people are die you say. Yes, but the virus don't kill them. The virus open a "door" in the cell wall thats allows for bacterias, how always are present,
to invade the body and create an aggressiv bacterial superinfection. That's
what kills them . See,

How can this happen? How can the doctors be so blind . Ihave a theory
about this and here it comes:




My	CbH6>  was a psychologist. May she rest in peace in heaven.




It seems that the corona virus has affected the brain more in a certain group in society, namely politicians, doctors, journalists and other with power and positions in the society. The virus is not dangerous for this group, but it's opens a door in the brain's cell wall that allows it to enter the fear center of the brain.

This door has been closed for many years. We haven't had any major wars and nothing has threatened them. They have felt invulnerable. Convinced of their own superior ability and greatness. Not only can they control the people, they can now control the climate by turning the carbon dioxide tap. If they close it, the temperature drops, if they open it the temperature goes up. They don't know that the sun is 109 times as big as our planet. 109 times. It seams so small when we look up in the sky. They thought they could control everything.




Then came the VIRUS, they receive an abrupt awakening. They get scared. Politicans get sick and die. Doctors die. The brain is attacked by fear virus. They can no longer think clearly and logically. The panic is near, they are reminded of their own mortality. Just like a virus in a computer. It's slows it down and it becomes unusable. Thats whats happen when a fear virus attacks the brain.




Here where Ilive, there are panic over 1600 confirmed cases. The telev ison is talking "infected persons" when there is "confirmed laboratory cases". It's two different things. Misleading the people. Why panic over 1600 infected? Closing all not nessecary buissness, all schools, all except for supermarket, gas station, banks. You can't go out after 5.00 pm. If you do, you get arrested.



Why? They are scared. Because the ruling class is afraid. Everyone with this masks. Doctors crying on television. The President with mask. They are scared. Doctors. Journalists. Polices.




2020. The year when the world got completely crazy.




You have an medical obligation to inform the world about the  truth.




Kind regards,

Subject: Invitation to join (virtually) the ACTIV Leadership Meeting 5/6


Dear Colleagues,

As you may be aware, the Accelerat ingCOVID-19 Therapeutic Intervent ions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public­ private partnership has been moving forward rapidly to address the global pandemic. We held our
initial ACTIV leadership meeting on April 3rd including, NIH,FDA,BARDA,EMA, and industry heads of research and development . Four working groups were formed out of this meeting to focus on preclinical therapeutics, clinical therapeutics, clinical trial capacity,and vaccines.

Although some ICs have representatives participating in the working groups, we recognize there is a need to keep everyone looped in to the var ious activities and progress of the partnership, particularly in view of all of the concurrent IC projects about COVID-19. The ACT IV working groups will be delivering
their second report to the ACTIV leadership Group on Wednesday,May 6,from 3:30-S:OOpm. Iam
writing to invite the ICDs to listen-in on this meeting. There will be a lot to cover during the meeting and
the members of the Leadership Group will be asking the questions.  But to give a cha nce for us NIHers to

discuss what has been presented, I am scheduling a separate ICD call for 5:05-5:30pm, immediately following the ACTIV leadership meeting.

If you are available to take part, please send your responses to David Wholley and Cheryl Melencio of FNIH (cc'd here) by noon tomorrow, May 5th.  Once you confirm your attendance, Cheryl will send you a calendar invite for both the ACTIV leadership meeting and the ICD follow-up call.

Best regards,
Francis

Hi Mikael,


Wow, sounds like you are making fantastic progress with the vaccine program, and we would certainly not want to do anything to slow you down!  I understand that you are evaluating several mRNA formats with BioNTech. If one of those turned out to be ready for phase 11/111 in late June, we would be most interested in the possibility of including that in the master protocol.  Please keep Tony and me in touch with Pfizer's progress, including which mRNA format you choose to move into advanced development.

Hope to hear your voice at the ACTIV Leadership Group meeting on Wednesday.
There will be a lot to talk about! Best, Francis

We certainly enjoy taking part in ACTIV


I will check if we did get our drugs on the lists below

(b)(4











 Iwill discuss w Kathrin Jansen if we may have an option to add one of our several vaccine formats that is less advanced or a refined format of our most advanced in the master protocol etc

If we can agree about shared key endpoints, we can include that cross all studies Whether
master protocol or more advanced sponsor trials which helps comparison

Hi Mikael,


Thanks for your note and this update on exciting progress on several fronts. ACTIV is moving forward with gratifying speed and commitment. With regard to vaccines, tomorrow the ACTIV vaccines WG will be discussing a master protocol for a phase 11/111 trial with adaptive design, multiple arms,and a shared placebo arm, aiming to launch on or about July 1. FDA is strongly supportive. The Moderna, Sanofi, and JnJ vaccines are likely to be included - might Pfizer also

- Itrust that compound is

on the list of therapeutic candidates that the Clinical Therapeutics WG

Thanks for your note. It would be great to have this connect ion - but let me suggest that you start with David Wholley (cc'd here), as he oversees all four of the ACTIV working groups. Joe is the program lead for the group on preclinical therapeutics/repurposing.

I hope you are having a good weekend.


Quick question: Would you be OK if I/we reached out to Joe Menetski, who I understand leads many of the ACTIV efforts. We have come to know Joe very well as a great collaborator on the AMP gene therapy initiative and It would be very easy I think working informally with Joe to look a bit more under the hood and identify/ map opportunities for alignment with the other initiatives.

We certainly enjoy taking part in ACTIV


Iwill check if we did get our drugs on the lists below

(b)(4










Iwill discuss w Kathrin Jansen if we may have an option to add one of our several vaccine formats that
is less advanced or a refined format of our most advanced in the master protocol etc


If we can agree about shared key endpoints , we can include that cross all studies Whether master protocol or more advanced sponsor trials which helps comparison

Hi Mikael,


Thanks for your note and this update on exciting progress on several fronts. ACTIV is moving forward with gratifying speed and commitment.   With  regard to vaccines, tomorrow the ACTIV vaccines WG will be discussing a master protocol for a phase 11/111 trial with adaptive design, multiple arms, and a shared placebo arm, aiming to launch on or about July 1. FDA is strongly supportive. The Moderna, Sanofi, and JnJ vaccines are likely to be included - might Pfizer also join?

Hi Tony,
Thanks! Hope you are doing well.
This is basically exactly wha t we are working to facilitate w ith our RADx and digital health (app) platform initiatives ...greatly expanding testing and creating a digital backbone to provide people w ith ways to access tests and interpret results. For expand ing testing platforms, see https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news­ events/newsroom/nih-mobil izes-national-innovation-initiative-covid-19-diagnostics    We have >700 applications that have been started in jus t a few days . For the digital health (e.g. app) platform we've put a lot of thought into the design and are hoping a contractor will be able to launch a pilot study of healthcare workers soon. Ned and Iplan on issuing additional calls in this area w ith multiple institutes
as stakeho lders in the coming weeks .

l. Ihad planned to write to thank you for giving an interview	(b)(6)  for the Washington Post last month. 'four generosity with time was 'all Tony,' and Idid appreciate it. was waiting for the chaos around you to subside before writing but.....
2. Last evening Iwas asked to forward the message below to you. You might already know Jack

Maryland                   (b)(6)    As  his  email  says,       (b)(      with  Samsung's  venture  capital  group,  which  has                             an idea for a future,comprehensive surveillance system for COVID-19                 (b)(4)
  It is interesting,
but all I know is what Iread in the power-point attached. Icannot imagine you would have time to look at it yourself, but perhaps it could be shared with other systems-orien ted individuals working towards 'opening up' responsibly.

Pardon me for stepping out of my normal NTD 'swim lane' but Idid want to help out	(b) (6)
- ,and certainly nothing is more important these days than COVID-19 and the outstanding work                                                    you are doing to manage it.

All the very best,

A voice from the past. Covid-19 prevented us from meeting up because it might yet bring at least the two of us together.




I'm writing


            Samsung's venture capital group and his team has what Ithink is an incredibly useful idea for contact tracing for covid-19 as well as actually opening the economy up again. The idea is contained within the attachment.

Iwonder if you still have any contacts with Anthony Fauci. Is so. could you see your way clear to forwarding the attachment to him? The group has identified some appropriate test manufacturers but is at the point where they need to know the spectrum so as to focus on the optimal ones. The thought was that Tony Fauci might be the best person to know what tests are in development stage.

What are your thoughts?

Don't worry about confidentiality; they want to widely share this idea so as to get it out as quickly as
possible.

This year, due to the impact of the coronavirus The Web by Awar ds are moving their renowned award show to an online ex perience. On May 19th,2020, the 24th Annual Webby Awards will bring together Webby W inners from around the world in an Internet Celebration which will showcase the artists, organizations, and creators using their platforms to imagine a better tomorrow through  information, education, movement, comedy, all while inspiring audiences to take action to enact positive change.

The 24th Annual Webby Awards are proud to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Person of the Year to recognize his creation of ncov2019.liv e to track the spread of COVID-19 across the world. We would be honored if Dr. Fauci would "virtually" present Avi with his award.

As we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVID-19 on the world and late calls for nation-wide social distancing, the Internet has become the lifeblood for people looking for accurate information about the novel coronavirus. Since launching the site on December 29th, Avi Schiffmann's tracking site was a necessary tool that sounded the alarm on the novel coronavirus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity long before many global officials.By providing over 100 million visitors with real-time data on the virus' spread, Schiffmann has helped people around the globe understand COVID-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and measures to flatten the curve.

For having the foresight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating a website to provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere, it is our great privilege to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Webby Person of the Year. The celebration will highlight the important work Avi and his fellow winners are doing, and will mark his hallmark Webby 5-Word acceptance speech in Internet history. Dr.Fauci's presenter speech could be recorded on his phone and we can send you through a script for him to review, edit and details for format and deadline .

This year's Webby Awards will also take action, the impact of COVID-19 and government responses around the world, has brought the importance of voting into sharp focus. The

Webby Awards has partnered with Vote.or and aim to check the voter registration status of 1million voters in the United States, promoting the importance of voting to help ensure
voter turnout this November is the highest it has ever been. This partnership will integrate into all elements of this year's online celebration.

Our thoughts are with all of you in this difficult time.


Best

Iwonder if you still have any contacts with Anthony Fauci. Is so, could you see your way clear to forwarding the attachment to him?

Don't worry about confidentiality; they want to widely share this idea so as to get it out as quickly as possible.

Dr. Fauci- Of course, I appreciate how busy you are, so just reaching out again on behalf of the American College of Cardiology as noted below. We were hopeful we could steal just an hour of your time in June for an important discussion on COVID- 19 and exercise training. This is part of a virtua l agenda for one of our national conferences (Care of the Ath letic Heart) with outreach around the world given this is a part of the ACC educational platform.


We hope this is something you have the bandwidth for, and simply appreciate your
consideration. I hope to hear from you and thank you for all your service once aga in. My best, Jonathan Kim

Dr. Fauci-


On behalf of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), first Iwould like to thank you for your tremendous service throughout your incredible career and certainly during these present and challenging times. We are indebted to your service and thankful everyday we have you to help guide public health measures through the COVID-19 pandemic .

Iam a member of the Sports and Exercise Council for the ACC and the Course Chair for our annual ACC Care of the Athletic Heart Conference. Originally scheduled June 18-20, 2020 at ACC Heart House in Washington DC. Iam also faculty at Emory University and direct our sports cardiology  program  in Atlanta.


Of course, we have made the difficult decision to cancel our live meeting in June, but myself along with the staff at ACC are working very hard transitioning the course to a virtual course and agenda. This course will be a much shorter version and the agenda will all be pre-recorded and distributed as a 'live simulated version' on June 20, 2020.

With the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of life and society, in our academic world of sports cardiology, we are dealing with how COVID has impacted exercise and athletes. As you can imagine, there are a multitude of different issues and questions that colleagues are raising.

One new session for our virtual agenda that we think will generate a lot of interest and is of high importance will be a panel discussion on sports, exercise, and COVI0-19. We would like to get additional expertise on the panel from the ID/public health and Sports Medicine arenas, in addition to sports cardiology. Of course, there is no one that carries the expertise you do from the ID and public health perspective and we would be extremely honored if you could be a part of this one session and join our fac ulty for the course.


Before getting into more details and a formal invite from the ACC, Iwanted to first see if you had the bandwidth for this. Understanding you are as busy, if not busier, than anyone in the world right now. This session would be pre-recorded and we would certain ly work to be flexible with anytime you had for this in early June to record.

I hope this is something that could work- again we would be honored to host you virtually. Many thanks for considering, and hope to hear from you soon. Best, Jonathan Kim

Ihope to find you well with this email.
Itake the liberty to write you beca use Ihave some concern about the misinformation that can discredit your task and honors.
On many occasions in tv and press, Antonio Giordano, Director of Sbarra Institute in Philadelphia,
Keeps saying that he is a member of the USA Task Force.
I'm wondering if it's true.


Iwork in UK, but I'm originally from Naples (Italy).

Iapologize if you find this email inopportune, the time is unfortunate, Igrant you.
Idon't like the idea that some people might take advantage of this very unpleasant moment for all the world. So Iwish that Imade a mistake this time.

I'm also wondering if you are willing to release a brief interview.
Istand with you and USA that Imiss very much

Subject: RE: FY 2020 - COVID-19 -Actual and Forecasted Spending - Weekly Report Ending 4/10/20 Tony,
YTD spending is $67.SM, unchanged* from last week .A summary is attached .


Ihave also attached an updated budget plan reflecting our projected spending by research category by fiscal year. We are updating this weekly as we receive updates from the divisions on the timing of clinical trials, observational studies, nat ural history studies and research resource needs.

We will report mid-week on our YTD spending which will be in sync with the data the Dept. extracts. Martin




 The reason that we have reported no weekly increase is to match our reported spending with the financial information that the Department is now extracting from our accounting system.  We have always included spending from our regular appropriat ion, as directed by the Department.  Now the guidance from the Dept. has been updated to report onlv spending from the supplemental COVID-
19 appropriations.

Tony,

YTD spending is $21.6M, a weekly increase of $4.0M for clinical trial site set-up for therapeutics, further vaccine development, small animal development, and therapeutic development (mAhs) and basic research.

Most of the $50M-$60M we listed last week we expect to be awarded before March 31. In many cases contractors have begun work without the award so as to not stall work.

Early next week I'll provide a summary spending plan for the additional $706M that NIAID
received in the supplemental appropriation signed by the President today. Martin

Tony,

Since we our last report we have increased spending on the COVID- 19 response by $0.2M for a
total YTD spending of $12.6M.

The $0.2M increase is for vaccine candidate development at NIAID Intramural Labs including RML. Costs are mostly for staffing and overhead and  include a preclinical immunogenicity

study designed to test the mRNA-1273 nCoV vaccine two-dose schedule inmice. The study will measure the immune response  to this vaccine  in an animal  model in anticipation  of clinical test in humans.

candidate at Kaiser Pennaneote \Vasbington Health Research Institute (One of tbe
VTEUs)

 $0.3M that supported University of Hong Kong researchers in the development of a RT­ PCR test to detect SARSCoV2 from human samples. The group has now shared the tests and relevant reagent s with over 30 labs globally to enable diag.nosis of COV1D-19.

  I did not "strongly" endorse it.  I specifically said that it was not a knockout drug and was only a baby step in the direction of developing more and better drugs. I said that it was important because it proved in a well-powered, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that one can suppress the virus enough to see a clinical effect, as modest as the effect was. I do not think I forced anything.
Happy to chat with you about it.

I am a bit perplexed by your seeming strong endorsement of remdesivir. Was it just a bit
forced?


My reading was the data were weak and in normal times for norma l disease it is not enough to to approve. And very unlikely to really impact COVID-19 disease pattern--regardless of supply issues.

Bethesda, MD 20892-9806 Dear Dr. Fauci:
Thank you for your tremendous steadfast leadership during this pandemic and
health crisis. Our nation has not faced a crisis of this magnitude since the 1918 Spanish Flu, but we will travel this journey together and defeat this virus . In the end, the nation will become stronger and more prepared .

     Your participation is requested in a Virtual Town Hall meeting hosted by ABC affiliate Channel 13 in Houston, Texas on Thursday, May 7, 2020 at 7:00 PM CDT. This town hall meeting will focus on testing and guidelines for re-opening our nation. It is scheduled to last an hour with 2 or 3 guests including yourself. Houston is the fourth largest city in the country and your knowledge and expertise would be most helpful in our fight to keep our infection and fatality rates low for this entire region and the State of Texas.

      My office has been pushing testing and setting up testing sites since the first notification of the coronavirus. We currently have seven active testing sites and expanding each week to get to the mass testing necessary to flatten the infection rate.

      Thank you for your consideration of this request and I look forward to participating with you in the Virtual Town Hall meeting. Again, thank you for your leadership. Please RSVP or if you have questions regarding this request with Glenn Rushing, my Chief of Staff at	(b)(6)  and Lillie Coney , my Chief
Policy Advisor a	(b)(

Very truly yours,
J
Sheila Jackson Lee Member of Congress

Zeke:
  I did not "strongly" endorse it. I specifically said that it was not a knockout drug and was only a baby step in the direction of developing more and better drugs. I said that it was important because it proved in a well-powered,randomized, placebo-controlled clinical tria l that one can suppress the virus enough to see a clinical effect, as modest as the effect was. I do not think I forced anything.
Happy to chat with you about it.
Best,
Tony

Tony,


I hope you and	are doing well. You are doing an amazing job under difficult
circumstances.  And just know we prefer the "real" Tony to the Brad Pitt version!!!


Iam a bit perplexed by your seeming strong endorsement of remdesivir. Was it just a bit
forced?


My reading was the data were weak and in normal times for norma l disease it is not enough to to approve. And very unlikely to really impact COVID-19 disease pattern--rega rdless of supply issues.

Stay safe

Dr. Fauci:


In preparation for the upcoming May 12th COVID-19 hearing of the Senate Health, Education , Labor, and Pensions Committee (Chair: Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-TN), we have drafted the attached NIAID testimony, building on your prior testimony
on COVID-19.  Drs. Giroir, Hahn, and Redfield also have been invited to the
hearing.


We expect that your testimony will be included as an insert to an HHS-wide testimony.  At the request ofNlli OD, we have incorporated into the draft COVID- 19 activities across NIH.


The testimony has been reviewed by the Divisions and Drs. Lane, Harper, Marston, and Lerner, as well as Courtney Billet, Greg Folkers, Martin Johnson, and Laurie Doepel.


NIH OLPA has asked to receive your testimony for clearance by ton1orrow  if
possible.


Thank you for your help.

 Tha nk you for you note. We will know soon w hether hydroxychloroquine has any beneficial effects as t he results of ra ndomized,controlled tria ls become
availa ble. The pathogenesis of COV ID-19 is still an open question.  You are correct
in that there is a more recent tendency to use ventilators only as a very last resort
since oxyge nation rather than ventilation appears to be key to recovery. Best rega rds,

Hi Dr Fauci,
Please find an audio attached of a doctor describing the experience with regards to covid 19 in the hospital. She seems to suggest covid 19 is a virus that rather attacks the blood cell, leading to respiratory and other organ complications, hence they need to loom at treatment in a different light. In the UK
some hospita ls have moved away from using ventilators due to the high death rate of those on ventilators,and are rather using ventilators for sleep apnea, as they are less invasive,and the results are much much better compa red to invasive ventilators

There are some anecdotal observations I have also made. The infection rate in most African countries seem to be comparatively low, w hich could possibly due to the rate of testing being conducted. However the death rates are also comparatively very low.From initial information w ith rega rds to

hydroxychloroquine  and some antimalaria drugs usage, it was suggested that those who were alleged to have had some benefits had mild symptoms of covid 19. I know some clinical trials have shown hydroxychloroquine not to be effective in the treatment of covid 19 in very ill patients. However, my hypothesis is, are the low death rates in Africa linked to the fact that malaria is very prevelant in Africa, and lots of Africans take antimalarial drugs, making them less susceptible to covid 19, hence the low death rate. Is there a similar trend in other countries where malaria is prevalent? Is there an unintended benefit of taking antimalarial drug (or other medication) before covid infection, or at the onset, making people less susceptible to covid19 .
As Isaid, this is based on anecdotal observations.


Yours sincerely Ato Stephens

Jeremy:

  Thanks for the heads up.  Is there any more detailed description of the precise clinical  manifestations?   They  describe  a  "multisystem  inflammatory  state".	It is vasculitis or anything more specific?   Could be an infectious agent that has nothing to do with SARS-CoV-2  infection even though some children are circumstantially infected with SARS-CoV-2or it could be a post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory syndrome, perhaps a Kawasaki syndrome-like disease.	Please keep me informed if you  hear  any further  information .

As you know, th·is is a 90 minute session which aims to provide our audience with deeper insights into the latest developments in the COVID-19 response. I plan to bold an engaging discussion that covers the whole experience on dealing with this pandemic -from US to international, to preparedness and response, the biology of the virus, the state of diagnostic, treatment and vaccine development, and the
importance of communication.

I will begin the session by providing brief ( 3 min) opening remarks describing the circumstances of the pandemic . Tben, 1will introduce the panelists and you will each have 7 minutes to provide remarks. You

may use a limited number of slides for illustration. J hope that each panelist will provide  their own perspective  and speak to  the issues proposed  below.
 Jeremy Farrar will discuss the global response to the pandemic, drawing from his experience as a global leader, the chair of the Scientific Advisory Group for the WHO's R&D Blueprint and as a member of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board.
 Tony Fauci will discuss the US pandemic and provide his perspective as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force addressing the 2019-20 corona.vims pandemic .
 George Gao will discuss China 's response to the pandemic and
lessons learned for the rest of the globe.
 Susan Weiss will discuss tbe viral characteristics of SARS COV2 , insights into its pathobiology, immunity and development ofa  pan-CoV antiviral.
 Richard Hatchett will discuss the development of new vaccines
and treatments against COVID-19.
 Sanjay Gupta will comment on the health system response to the pandemic and challenges related to communication and public engagement in responding to COVID-19.


Following remarks from each panelist, we wi11 have a moderated discussion amongst ounelves -I will ask you a set of questions ( 15 mins) and then we will take questions from the web (25 mins). To prepare me to be your moderator, please send me any questions you would like me to ask you. For those of you who would like to have a prep call, please let me know and I will set it up.

Best,

Since many of us have moved to remote work environments, you may already be proficient with Zoom and other online meeting/collaboration applications. I am attaching a 'speaker guidelines' file in case you have any questions on how best to prepare for and stage your remote talk. We have technical staff available to help you become familiar with Zoom and its settings - such as "sharing your screen" (if you have slide presentations that
need to be shown during your talk) .We can arrange for a training session this week or next week. If you would like to schedule a session, please let me know as soon as possible.

Dr. Dzau's office will be in touch regarding the agenda for this session. If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Dear Dr. Fauci,


I had the honor to interview you in april 2016 about the zika epidemic at your office for a program for national Swedish radio as their global health correspondent. I hope Imay have the honor again now Sir?

Iam now working as science correspondent for the national Swedish Television (non commercial public service, half the population as daily viewe rs) in our official Nobel prize laureaute documentary program "Vetenskapens Varld" (the World of Science) and wonder if you have any chance to give us a 10 minute interview by web video before May 7th please?

Iwould like to ask you two questions: What is most crucial now to suceed with an covid-19 pandemic exit in the US? How do you find the Swedish strategy against Covid-19 so far (Dr. Mike Ryan praised it yeasterday at the WHO press conference as a model for an exit strategy, what is your view)?

In this one hour program aired on May 11th we will have other prominent scientists as well talking about exit strategies, among others Nobel prize winner prof. Paul Krugman, prof. Bengt Holmstrom MIT, prof. Angus Deaton Princeton, as well as Prof Gabriel Leung Dean University Hongkong etc.

Here you can see the reports Idid from my earlier interview with you about the zika epidemic in 2016 (in Swedish). News report: https://sverigesradi o.se/artikel/642089120 min documentary : https://sverigesrad io.se/avsnitt/7120 16

One option is that I send you a link for a web video Conference call. Another option is that Icall you on the phone and your media department may have the oportunity to record a video of your anseers with HD quality that is better to air.

Please let me know if you are available and when. Best regards,
Johan Bergendorff

Fauci says leak concerns fueled his White House revelation of Gilead drug results
Jul ie Steenhuysen
5 Min Read
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Concerns over leaks compelled the top U.S. infectious disease official to revea ldata on Gilead Sciences Inc's experimental drug remdesivir, the first in a scientifically rigorous clinical trial to show benefit in treating COVI0-19.




National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci attends a coronavirus response meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 29, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria
The dramatic announcement by Dr Anthony Fauci in the Oval Office on Wednesday prompted concerns among scientists that the Trump administration was raising hopes about a coronavirus treatment before sharing the full data with researchers.
As a cautionary example of inflating the potential value of a therapy, some pointed to President Donald Trump's repeated endorsements of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, with no evidence that it works .
Newer data suggests the malaria treatments may carry significant risks for some sufferers of the respiratory disease caused by the virus.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is running the trial, said he took the first opportunity to get the word out that patients taking a dummy treatment or placebo should be switched to remdesivir in hopes of benefiting from it.
He expressed concern that leaks of partial information would lead to confusion .Since the White House was not planning a daily virus briefing, Fauci said he was invited to release the news at a news conference with Louisiana Gov.John Bel Edwards(D). "It was purely driven by ethical concerns," Fauci told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"I would love to wait to present it at a scientific meeting, but it's just not in the cards when you have a situation where the ethical concern about getting the drug to people on placebo dominates the conversation."
An independent data safety and monitoring board, which had looked at the preliminary results of the NIAID trial, determined it had met its primary goal of reducing hospital stays.

On Tuesday evening, that information was conveyed in a conference call to scientists studying the drug globally.
"There are literally dozens and dozens of investigators around the world," Fauci said. "People were starting to leak it." But he did not give details of where the unreported data was being shared. Several scientists interviewed by Reuters felt the White House setting seemed inappropriate for the release of highly anticipated government-funded trial data on the Gilead therapy.
They had expected it to be presented simultaneously in a detailed news release, a briefing at a medical meeting or in a scientific journal, allowing researchers to review the data.
Information from various trials of remdesivir has been leaked to media in recent weeks . In a statement on Wednesday, Gilead said the NIAID's much anticipated trial had met its primary goal, but gave no details.
Data in a separate NIAID statement after Fauci spoke detailed preliminary results showing that patients who got the drug had a 31 percent faster time to recovery than those who got a placebo, cutting hospital stays by four days.
The trial also came close to showing the drug helped people survive the disease, but the data fell just short of statistical significance.
"I want to see the full data. Iwant to understand the statistics. Iwant to understand the benefit and risk. Iwant to understand the structure of the study, and all of it," said Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief academic officer at the Cleveland Clinic.
"Am I encouraged from what I've heard? Yes, I'm encouraged . But I want to get a full understanding of what happened here, and not get it via a photo opportunity from the Oval Office."
Data Gilead released on its own trial of remdesivir drew less attention, as it did not compare outcomes between those receiving therapy and those who did not.
Results from a third study in China suggesting remdesivir failed to help COVID-19 patients were released
in the British medical journal the Lancet after review by a peer group of scientists .
"That's the only thing I'll hang my hat on, and that was negative," said Dr. Eric Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.
He was unimpressed by remdesivir's modest benefit.
"It was expected to be a whopping effect," Topol added. "It clearly does not have that."
At the Oval Office news conference, Fauci compared the study findings to AZT, the first drug to show any benefit against HIV, decades ago.
"We know that was an imperfect drug. It was the first step," Fauci said in the interview.
"Similar to AZT, it's (remdesivir) the first baby step towards what hopefully will be a number of better drugs that will come in and be able to treat people with COVID-19."

Dear Dr. Pape:


Ilead the World Health Organization (WHO) delegation to the United Nations and know of you through Tony Fauci and Henry Masur,	(b)(6).  For nearly 5 years immediately preceding my appointment at WHO,, Iwas an technical advisor at Hopital Sacre-Creur in Milot and remain in close contact with institution. Because of this, PAHO leadership asked me to join their COVID- 19 planning discussions related to Haiti. I understand from Henry that you have been appointed by MSPP to coordinate COV ID-19 preparedness and response activities. If you have some time available on Friday, it would be good to talk via Zoom or Webex.  I can arrange this and would plan to have the
PAHO deputy director as well as other PAHO officials on the line. Would you be available Friday afternoon for such a discussion?   If not Friday, anytime over the weekend would a lso likely work on our end.

Thanks so much for considering this.
With best regards, Stewart Simonson STEWART SIMONSON

Subject: NAO repletion for Covid-19
Importance: High


Dear Dr. Fauci,


Recent research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 plays havoc with NAO function wit hin cells.


Coronavirus Infection and PARP Expression Dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: A Potentially Actionable Component of Innate Immunity :
https : //www.bio rxiv.org/content/1 0.110 1/2020. 04.1 7.047480v3


The Molecular Story of COVID-19; NAO+ Depletion Add resses All Questions in this Infection: https://www.preprints.org/manuscri  pt/202003.0346/vl

Other research has shown that NAO+ levels decline from aging and obesity, both significant factors in Covid-19 severity. But it has also been demonstrated that NAO levels can be replenished through ora l administration of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleot ide (NMN). NR in particular has had several human studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy, and roughly 50 human studies listed on clinicaltrials.gov for all manner of disorders .

There is at least one anecdotal report of dramatic improvement in a Covid-19 patient after

administration of NMN.


NMN shows great promise in case studies of humans with COVID-19:
https://alivebynature.com/nmn-shows-promise-for-treatment-of-covid-19-in-case-
studies/?utm      campaign=NM N%20for%20covid%20%28T qFTyz%29&utm       medium=email&utm      source= Main%20List&  ke=eyJrbF91bWFpbCl61CJtZWxAZGlzdHJpYnVOZWwuY2EiLCAia2xfY29tcGFueV9pZCl61CJS bWROWFoifQ%3D%3D

That article begins with the disclaimer, "There are no human trials that prove effectiveness of any NAO+ boosting suppfements for preventing or curing COVID-19."

That is a problem.  When Isee the resources that have been wasted pursuing hydroxychloroquine, Iam saddened to learn that there are no clinical trials of nicotinamide riboside as part of a treatment regimen for Covid-19. Can you do anything about getting such a study done?

Regards,
Mel Cohen

Dr. Fauci,


First, thank you for everything you are doing.  Ihave always been grateful for your public service, but
feel particularly indebted to you these days.


To add to the debt...Josh and Iwanted to see if you would be willing to join a call with Business Roundtable CEOs. We have been doing COVID-19 calls with them every Friday at 1:30pm. Typically, about 100-125 CEOS of large, U.S.-based firms will join.	They are all managing and planning for difficult issues around employee and customer safety. They would love to hear from you directly and to ask a few questions.	It might also be a good place to deliver any messages you want them to hear.

We completely understand if it isn't doable, of course. If you are able, we would love to host you sometime between 1:30pm-2:30pm this Friday {or any Friday on which your schedule would allow it).

Best, Kristen

Talked to FDA. They have written (and cleared with Gilead) a new sentence in place of what we had in there about an EUA. Our release has been updated (attached) w ith the sentence highlighted below.

ALSO: Bi ll Hall called me to ask i f you had alerted the Secretary to th i s (so the press release clearance process isn't the way he first learns of it). Itold him Iwasn't sure. If you haven't done so, perhaps you wish to now?




As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's commitment to expediting the developm ent and availability of potential COVID-19 treatments, the agency has been engaged in sustained and ongoing discussions with Gilead Sciences regarding making remdesivir available to patients as quickly  as possible, as appropriate .

GILEAD SCIENCES STATEMENT ON POSITIVE DATA EMERGING FROM NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY  AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES' STUDY OF REMDESIVIR


Foster City, Calif., April 29, 2020 -Gilead Sciences. Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) is aware of the positive data emerging from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' (NIAID) study of remdesivir. We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.


In addition to the NIAID trial, Gilead expects to share additiona l remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial inpatients with severe COVID- 19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.

Gilead will  continue  to  discuss  with  regulatory  authorities  the  growing data  set
regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

InJanuary 2016 I sent a letter to Mr Trump	(b) C6l telling him that 1was happy that he
will bring change to America and the world and that if he needed my expertise that Iwould help your country and
the world. As I have not got any responses from him nor his peopl e I can see that he might not be interested. But as I have been following you over the media and be reading about your carrier as a Doctor Ibelieve you know what your doing and would like to take this opportuniiy to help you and your country at this time when it's the worst then ever before in the modem world.  have a program that can help with the coronavirus in the way of identifying people
and following there movement that can help you collect data faster and more sufficient. The program is based on an app so every one can use it. Countri es in Europe are start ing to use it by the end of May the Europe Union has made it mandatory that all member states need to use i t and the future members like Serbia. So you will see attached a presentation about the program and if you or your country is interested please let me know and Iwill put you in contact with the company making this program. ldid not send this email to you so we make money on people .it's to
help f j ust wanted to help . l will be contacting my contacts in the USA from Thursday moming but first 1wanted to
talk with you and give you the opportunjty to see if Mr Trump would interested in this program for your country. If
nothing comes back from you anyway my f1iend and contact in the USA will talk with the white house but lwanted
to do it the proper way by ta lking to you as you are the main medical person in the USA for the coronavirus.

Anyway wish you and your country all the best and that the world will become a better place after th is epidemic is
over.

lt's one life one world one human we arc all one on this planet no one is bigger or better the all of us as humanity as one.

Older adults with COVID-19,the illness caused by the coronavirus,have several "atypical" symptoms, complicating efforts to ensure they get timely and appropriate treatment, according to physicians. COVID- 19 is typically signaled by three symptoms: a fever, an insistent cough and shortness of breath. But older adults - the age group most at risk of severe complications or death from this condition - may have none of these characteristics.
Instead, seniors may seem "off" - not acting like themselves - early on after being infected by the coronavirus. They may sleep more than usual or stop eating. They may seem unusually apathetic or confused, losing orientation to their surroundings. They may become dizzy and fall. Sometimes,seniors stop speaking or simply collapse .

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Iam the co-founder of SAGE Wor ldwide, a global speaker and consulting company.  Iam reaching out on behalf of one of my partners, Robert Karofsky, Co-President of UBS Investment Bank, with an invitation to join the UBS Global response to Covid-19 in a live streaming moderated discussion on May 18. Alternatively your conversation could be pre-recorded to accommodate your busy schedule.  At this critically important time in our nation's history, the investment community wants to help our nation
fight Covid-19 and use our country's economic engine to find a cure and solutions for Covid-19. They also are thinking through how to help our nation's businesses going forward. Your expertise is important to this conversation .

By way of background, I served in the White House for eight years in the Bush Administration as the Social Secreta ry to Vice President Cheney . In that capacity, I had the privilege of curating a range of discussions with global thinkers and thought leaders on the world's most pressing topics. At SAGE, we bring that level of excellence to our business partners as we help curate discussions that have an impact on public awareness and investor sentiment, which is particularly important as the U.S. responds to Covid-19.



Participants at the UBS Global Healthcare Conference provide critical funding to pharmaceuticals and
healthcare research and are the businesses on the frontline of the Covid-19 healthcare response.


Attached please find an invitation from UBS with further details of the event . Iwelcome the opportunity to hear from you at your earliest convenience, and thank you for your important work and dedication to our country's well being over the course of your distinguished career and service at NIAID.

Dear Dr. Anthony Fauci,

My name is Dane Cohn, and Iam an	(b)(6J . Ihave often listened to your inspiring words on the news and followed your assiduous work to help us through this pandemic. Our school participates in Model UN, an event in which high
ous countries in debates on international issues from the

--	--

Model UN conference was canceled , so our school
) decided to host an online conference for the whole state

of Colorado and beyond . Our team would like to formally invite you to give a short
address (be it pre-recorded or live online) to the students during our opening ceremony .

We hope that our conference will inspire the youth of our nation and the world to stand up and fight for our future rather than resign their aspirations to lockdown. We host this conference because we see the importance of keeping our academic passions going while staying safe within the confines of our homes. We host this conference because we want to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 - money raised from our conference will go towards buying masks, food, and other resources for those who need it most.

This is why we ask you, a hero during this troubling time, to speak to the students of our conference, who not only include the youth of Colorado, but also the youth of our country and world. Any type of address would be greatly and wholeheartedly appreciated. If your address is pre-recorded ,we would appreciate it if we could receive it by May 1st, as our conference is the morning of May 2nd . We believe you can bring true inspiration into our hearts and minds. We know you are very busy, but if it were at all possible to share with us even a short 2-3 minute pre-recorded greeting and message to the students participating in this Model UN conference, it would be truly inspirational. Thank you so much for your time , we hope to hear from you soon.

Most Respectfully,
Dane Cohn and the entire ..._	--Model UN Team

Hi Adrienne,


I hope you're doing well.


I'm reaching out because Chair Delauro would like to invite Dr. Fauci to a hearing next Wednesday, May 6, with the House LHHS appropriations subcommittee . The focus of the hearing,not surprisingly, would be COVID-19. Members of the subcommittee would very much like to hear from Dr. Fauci on anything related to COVID-19, but Ithink the main topics would be:
 Mitigation and Test ing; and
 Progress on vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, as well as necessary preparations to manufacture and
disseminate a vaccine once it
is ready.


Chair Delaura is flexible about a starting time for the hearing on Wednesday, so she would be happy to accommodate a time that works for Dr. Fauci's schedule.

Please let me know as soon as possible, so we can plan accordingly.

Thanks so much, Stephen

I write to request your help in advising the transportation community about how to manage through the present  crisis, particularly as some areas are easing restrictions. I would welcome an opportunity to join you in a Q/A, which could be valuable for rideshare companies	(b) (   ), transit agencies, airlines etc. I would think that a 10-15 minute chat would do wonders. That said, I know you are terribly busy and have so many th ings to do but would appreciate any opportunity to help you get important infonnation out.

This could be pulled together rapidly and done within the next week or so..

Subject: Re: Covid thrombi

Dear Tony,


Italked with Dr.Viecca this morning who shared additional information about his protocol. They started from the pathologica l observat ion that a llpatients dying of Covid-19 pneumonia had diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis . Since they detectedalmost exclusively white thrombi,they reasoned that they had to block platelet activation/aggregation, while heparin would be ineffective at that stage. Thus, they treated a first group of five critical patients with potent a nti-aggregant therapy (Tirofiba n/Aggrastat) and apparently in all of them the p02 started to rise within less than 2 hours, they got off the ventilators and went on to full recovery . V iecca is an interventional cardiologist	(b) (4)

Isent copy of his protocol and contact information to Joe.


Let me know if Ican be of any further help. All the best, Paolo

Summary :With a	(b)(5) investment from federal stimulus funding, RADx initiative w ill infuse fund ing into early innovation technolog ies to speed developmen t of rapid and widely accessible COVID-19 testing. At the same time, NIH will seek opportunities to move more advanced diagnostic technolog ies swiftly through the development pipeline toward commercialization and broad availability . As part of the initiative, NIH is urging scientists and inventors with a rapid
test ing technology to compete in a national COVID-19 testing challenge for a share of up to $500
million over all phases for f urther development.The goal is to add tens of millions per month of accurate and easy-to-use tests to all Americans by Fall 2020.
Impact on COVID-19 Pandemic Response:RADx w ill accelerate the development, va lidation, and commercialization of innovative new testing methods that can be deployed in point-of-care and home sett ings. These technologies are urgently needed to guide and inform safe return to work, school,and  life activities.

Subject: FOR ASF REVIEW: Draft PR re: SARS-CoV-2 incidence in children Hi Dr. Fauci,
Please find attached for your review a draft release about the launch of the Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS) study, which is intended to help determine the percentage of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the percentage of infected children who develop COVID. In addition,the study will examine whether rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection differ between children who have asthma or other allergic conditions and children who do not. Your draft quote is as follows :

"One interesting feature of this novel coronavirus pandemic is that very few children

have become sick with COVID-19 compared to adults," said NIAID Director Anthony s. Fauci,

M.D. "Is this because children are resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2, or because they are

infected but do not develop symptoms? The HEROS study will help us begin to answer these and other key questions."


Thanks much, Kathy

Topic: Statement by ASF during Saturday NAS web briefing Deadline: urgent

Hi Patty,


Elizabeth would like to clarify something that Dr. Fauci apparently said about remdesivir during his NAS web briefing on Saturday. The transcribed segment of the talk that she is focused on says:

"Remdesivir is the one that's gotten the most publicity. It is interesting that if you look at it in a prophylactic therapeutic model in MERS coronavirus infection, it looked pretty good. There was clinical benefits just reported a couple of weeks ago of SARS coronavirus 2 in rhesus macaques."


She wants to clarify what Dr. Fauci meant by looking at remdesivir "in a prophylactic therapeutic model in MERS"-whether this means in an animal model or something else. It sounds like that phrase is referring to the RML study in which remdesivir successfully prevented disease in MERS-infected rhesus macaques, as reported in the Feb. 13 NIAID media availability pasted below. Is that correct?


Best,
Laura



Remdesivir Prevents MERS Coronavirus Disease in Monkeys Results Support Testing Antiviral Against 2019 Novel Coronavirus February 13, 2020
The experimental antiviral remdesivir successfully prevented disease in rhesus macaques infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), according to a new study from National Institutes of Health scientists . Remdesivir prevented disease when administered before infection and improved the condition of macaques when given after the animals already were infected.
The new report from NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases {NIAID) appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
MERS-CoV is closely related to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known
as 2019-nCoV) that has grown to be a global public health emergency since cases were first
detected in Wuhan, China, in December.
Remdesivir has previously protected animals against a variety of viruses in lab experiments. The drug has been shown experimentally to effectively treat monkeys infected with Ebola and Nipah viruses. Remdesivir also has been investigated as a treatment for Ebola virus disease in people.
The current study was conducted at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton,
Montana. The work involved three groups of animals: those treated with remdesivir 24

hours before infection with MERS-CoV; those treated 12 hours after infection (close to the peak time for MERS-CoV replication in these animals); and untreated control animals.
The scientists observed the animals for six days. All control animals showed signs of
respiratory disease. Animals treated before infection fared well: no signs of respiratory disease, significantly lower levels of virus replication in the lungs compared to control animals, and no lung damage. Animals treated after infection fared significantly better than the control animals: disease was less severe than in control animals, their lungs had lower levels of virus than the control animals, and the damage to the lungs was less severe.
The scientists indicate that the promising study results support additional clinical trials of
remdesivir for MERS-CoV and COVID-19, the disease that SARS-CoV-2 causes. Several clinical trials of remdesivir for COVID-19 are under way in China, and other patients with COV ID-19 have received the drug under a compassionate use protocol.
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, also provided support for this study. Gilead Sciences, Inc.,developed remdesivir, also known as GS-5734, and collaborated in the research.
MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Through December 2019, the World Health
Organization had confirmed 2,499 MERS-CoV cases and 861deaths (or about 1in 3). Because about one-third of MERS-CoV cases spread from infected people being treated in healthcare settings, the scientists suggest that remdesivir could effectively prevent disease in other patients, contacts of patients, and healthcare workers. They also note the drug might help patients who are diagnosed with MERS or COVID-19 if given soon after symptoms start.

Please contact me for how to place the order if you are interested or need more information.

So far, this array has mainly been used for two purposes: 1) Sero-survei llance studies of COVID-19 infection, and 2) Evaluating antibody reactivity in animals (monkeys and mice) after vaccinat ion. Please be advised that our array is for research use only (RUO), not for the diagnostic purpose which needs the FDA approval.
After you run the samples on the slide, you may read the slide on the following compatible machines: https://www.innopsys .com/en/lifesciences-products/microa  rrays/innoscan https://www.moleculardevices.com/products/additional-products/genepix-microarray-systems­

Subject:Otto e Mezzo - Italian Show Dear Mr. Fauci,
I'm Patrizia Torchia , I'm a journalist and Iam a member of the team on the Italian show Otto e Mezzo,
hosted daily by journa list Lilli Gruber on La7 channel.


I'm reaching out to invite you in our show. Mrs. Gruber wou ld be honored to have you, Dr. Fauci explore in more depth the challenges Coronav irus has forced the world to face . Can make this happen?

Below is Lilli Gruber's bio and a brief description of the show.


WHO :


Lilli Gruber is the editor- in-chief and host of Italy's most influential politicaldaily talk show, "Otto e mezzo",airing on prime-time on La7 TV . She's received Italy's most prestigious journa lism awards for her work and was the first woman to ever conduct the prime-time News broadcast in Italy (RAI TV,
1987).As a foreign correspondent she covered most of last 30 years' major wor ld events, from the fall of the Berlin wall to 9/11to the Iraq war .Beside her telev ision work, Ms. Gruber wrote eleven bestseller books including "Eredita", which was top seller for 20 weeks and ran 14 reprints. In 2004,Ms.Gruber

won a head-to-head campaign against Silvio Berlusconi by a large margin of votes and was elected to the European Parliament. There, among other appointments, she was the Head of the EU Delegation to the Gulf States and Yemen and a member of the EU Delegation to Iran.

"Otto e mezzo"


Italy's most influential political daily ta lk show shown on prime-time on La7 TV. Through interviews with elected political figures and candidates for office,commentators,and journal ists, the show focuses on international political news and economy with a special focus on Italy and Europe. Beginning in
2008 "Otto e Mezzo"  became Lilli Gruber's way to keep her commitment to holding those in power accountable by asking questions and touching on topics citizens are curious about. Otto e
Mezzo airs Monday to Saturday from 8:3Spm to 9:10pm. Within this time-frame Paolo Pagliaro's news column "II Punto" stands out for accuracy and thoughtfulness by pulling the thread on the highest rated issues in an agenda . During the current season Otto e Mezzo has become Italy's most watche d political talk show reaching an average of 7.3% of share with 2.5 million viewers per day.

We are wondering if Dr. Fauci would like to have a taped Skype conversation with PayPal CEO and President Dan Schulman to talk about safety measures, health and science tied to COVID-19. We would air the conversation during a global employee all hands to our 23,000 employees and then we could syndicate parts of it externally on our social channels.

Thanks for any help in reaching Fauci's team .

Thanks, Jeremy.	I saw the report in the Post from Saturday.	These children had mostly respiratory disease and diarrhea.	I will check with the docs at DC Children's Hospital about the presence of "multisystem inflammatory state". This could just be the advanced stage of their disease compatible with advanced

Jeremy:
  Thanks for the heads up.  Is there any more detailed description of the precise clinical manifestations?  They describe a "multisystem inflammatory state".	It is vasculitis or anything more specific?   Could be an infectious agent that has nothing to do with SARS-CoV-2 infection even though some children are circumstantially infected with SARS-CoV-2or it could be a post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory syndrome, perhaps a Kawasaki syndrome-like disease.	Please keep me informed if you hear any further  information.

Dear Jeremy, Tony, Sanjay, George, Susan, and Richard,


I'm really looking forward to this panel on COVID-19 at the NAS Annual Meeting on Saturday, April 25th at 2:00-3:30 pm ET. There is tremendous excitement and enthusiasm, and registration is through the roof.

Iam sending this note to do a last minute check to see if there is anything you need from me. I also want to check whether you are planning to use slides.
Will you be sending your slides to us to project or use the share screen feature to advance your own slides? Regardless, it would be helpful to me if you could send me your slides for my preparation.

Iwould greatly appreciate it if you would respond to this email.


Best,

OKAY, so here is something even better than having Brad Pitt portray me on SNL.	It is a recent review of Pitt 's performance in which the TV reviewer said :

 "Kicking things off, the Oscar winner dropped jaws during the cold open with his monologue about President Donald Trump's recent (and concerning) comments about COVID-19.

"Good evening, I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci," Pitt began his monologue and looked nearly identical to the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."

Someone said Pitt looked "nearly identical" to me. Yikes!!	Q

Dr. Fauci Ijust wanted to express my profound appreciation to you for your wor k during this COVID-19 pandem ic. Iespecially appreciate how you have spent considerable time and capital reaching out to the Black and brown communities. Isaw exerts of your snapchat w ith Will Smith and saw near ly all of your interview on the Breakfast Club. I regret Ihave to send an ema ilto you re this matter. But this is the
day we live in. Minority communities continue to be over- looked in crises and the impact of such crises
on their respect ive communiti es. For you to be intentional about keeping the minority commun ities in the loop is commenda ble, especially since these communities wi ll be absorbing the disproportionate share of the sicknesses and deat hs coming from COVID-19.

Thanks for all of what your are doing in keeping the nation informed. Thanks for informing based on the facts, data, and truth.

Take care and "Cover your six."

Thanks for sending this. There has been a lot of guidance on disinfection and cleaning, notably some very recent collaborative work we have done with EPA (https://www .cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communi  ty/reopen­
guidance.html).  Attached are two documents focused on re-opening America
with emphasis on cleaning and disinfection, including high-touch surfaces. Also below are a number of websites that address cleaning and disinfection which point out the importance of disinfecting high-touch locations like doorknobs. They give guidance how to clean them, but they don't address methods for using a paper towel or Kleenex to first turn the knob and then discard the towel.	(b)(5)

Hi there,

Please see below. HHS is taking over the Partnership for Public Service IG account next week for Public Service Recognition Week. They asked if Dr. Fauci would be willing to do a short 30-second or less pre­ recorded video thanking public servants for their wo rk. It would be featured during the takeover , and also on NIH's other sm handles next week . It can be taken on a cell phone as sm does not require higher resolution. Let me know if you would like to accept or decline the request.

Many thanks,

Hello All,


Hope everyone is holding up well!


OHR is taking over the Partnership for Public Service (PPS) lnstagram account during Public Service Recognition Week (May 3-9, 2020). The OHR team has reached out about wanting to develop a senior leader "mashup" video -perhaps including the DepSec. T


They asked about the feasibility of this request. They also inquired about perhaps Dr. Fauci and
the SG doing a pre-recorded video thanking public servants for their work.


Iwanted to gather the troops so we can identify what all is being planned for this week of
recognition and provide a POC for OHR if the request is feasible. Happy to set up a call, if that is needed to discuss further .
Thanks,
J anell

Iwanted to give you an update on called Sara Alert, the software program I am leading at MITRE. Sara Alert is being provided free of any costs and deployed in state, tribal, and local health departments to support public health in contact tracing and active monitoring of individuals in isolation and quarantine. We are engaged with ASTHO, NACCHO, CSTE, and the application is hosted live on APHL's AIMS platform. Sara Alert officially launched on April 3 and is currently supporting multiple jurisdictions including Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Danbury, CT, and the State of Arkansas. It is
also being rolled out in Washington, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maine and Vermont. We are getting
ready to launch in additional jurisdictions over the next couple of weeks.


We have recently responded to questions we were told came from the White House so Iwanted to make sure you have background materials. I imagine you are the person that the President and Vice President would turn to for information. I am happy to arrange any briefing materials or demo that would be helpful for you to respond.

As Imentioned previously, Sara Alert is a standards-based, open source tool that automates the process of monitoring individuals exposed to or infected with COVID-19 (or any disease, it's configurable) - and will serve as an enduring national resource to contain disease. Sara Alert is free for use by public health organizations.

Best wishes to you. Stay healthy for all of us. Paul

ABOUT SARA ALERT
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit that works in the public interest, developed Sara Alert, a standards-based, open source tool in partnership with national public health organizations. Sara Alert automates the process of monitoring individuals exposed to or infected with COVID-19 (or any disease, it's configurable) - and will serve as an enduring national resource to contain disease. Sara Alert is free for use by public health organizations.

 Sara Alert allows public health officials to import and enroll individuals (or households) at risk of developing or infected with COVID-19.
 Individuals enter their symptoms daily via web, text,email or phone, allowing public health officials to focus on high risk and non-reporting individuals.
 The web-based tool enables increased efficiency in tracking cases, leading to earlier
containment of the virus and reduction of burden on public health resources.
 Sara Alert is a national system and allows transferal of monitorees across jurisdictions for tighter contact tracing.
Sara Alert launched on April 3 and is now supporting multiple jurisdictions. Sara Alert YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/IQxAuNsg-RA

Subject: RE: Your query to Dr. Kadlec

Dear Francis,


It was a pleasure to hear from you, and yes, it has been a long time since we met or even spoke. Moons ago I was set to write to you after reading your wonderful
book, but I ended up instead speaking with others about it. I should add at this point that I did not quickly respond to your email of a few days ago because I simply missed it.

It is true that Istrongly suggest that OPV be quickly (already it is not quickly) brought forward for induction of a strong innate immune response to prevent or markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severity until the field obtains a proven safe and efficacious vaccine producing a long lasting, adaptive immunity. OPV is very safe (notably for OPV 1and 3 as bOPV which we will use and completely safe in a vaccinated population), simple, cheap, rather obvious, yet unique among the massive number of vaccines many (maybe most) of which are the same or at least if not exactly the same aiming at the same mechanism (targeting the spike and searching for the putative correlate of neutralizing Abs. ).

OPV should work for a few months and possibly longer. Also it should be working multiple times so I think could cover more than a few months, giving us time for a proven vaccine of adaptive immunity, which might be very long lasting as is hoped.

In the main the WHO comments are correct. Of course we sought and have letters of support from them as well as from many others. Though they are again supportive in their notes to you, there is one item that surprises me. They add that there was no clinical efficacy results as yet. They know or certainly should know that there is plenty of clinical data for this concept with BCG, OPV, and live Measles vaccine. Needless to say this is what turned me on during our regular Global Virus Network (GVN)conference calls. (Incidentally GVN is an organization I have thought of bringing to your attention. Ithink you would find it impressive and useful). I would be happy to share with you the clinical observations with OPV if you wish.

Iwould like to take a small diversion, but I suspect you are aware of these things. My colleagues and I respect the WHO because of its representation and because we have colleagues/friends there as well. However, sometimes bureaucracy of a
massive degree leads to inaction or even much worse-- political expediency. I won't
bother you with details of these  unless you ask, but I had such experiences with HTLV-1 which we discovered in 1980 as the 1st human retrovirus and which cause not only the highest incidence of cancer(% of infections) of any virus and other
fatal diseases as well but mainly in less developed countries (plus Japan) and again
with HIV in 1984. Behavior was not beneficial. Perhaps it will be of relevance in the future because a few at WHO took a position to remove OPV (Sabin) in favor of IPV (Salk) in their polio eradication scheme. It was a huge failure. As my FDA collaborator, Konstantin Chumakov, says "Blessed be Bill Gates" because he saved OPV and saved the day and in so doing has produced a still better OPV.

There is indeed data also for BCG as well as live Measles though I know less of the latter. BCG is less available, requires injection, harder to make, not as safe, and we think unlikely to be as effective as OPV. Nonetheless, we favor its use too. The mechanisms will be similar.

You asked whether monkey trials are planned. For several reasons definitely not -­ though we are planning some monkey experiments, but not large enough for "clinical" conclusions. The main reasons are: 1) cost; 2) that billions not thousands or millions have received OPV safely and in our collective view (and we know the studies pretty well) protection has been clinically shown; 3) In a pandemic we wished to move quickly (so far we must say that has not been achieved). A typical monkey vaccine study will take time, but 4) in this case it would be a huge amount of lost time as monkeys require great doses of polio for infection and monkeys
have to be trained to drink their orange juice. It would be hard to imagine that such studies would even give us useful information.


On a final digression Francis I have had 36 years of on/off experiences with glycosylated spike proteins-their analyses immunologically and especially regarding use in vaccines and developing neutralizing Abs. I believe it will be a mistake to put most eggs in that basket. The risks: shortened antibody half life; 2) protection NOT correlating with neutralizing Abs; 3) sometimes hazards from them. Admittedly, they might work, but I trust and hope that not everything is going in this bag. If you wish to discuss this again I will be available.

Finally, I hd no idea you were into vaccines or SARS-2 nor any part of CoVID-19 disease, but I am very happy to learn this.

Thanks.

Bob Gallo

Dear Bob,


It's been quite a while since we've chatted. Bob Kadlec asked me to respond to your query about the possible use of OPV to activate innate immunity and provide COVID-19 protection. Has this been tested in a non-human primate model? Inote the recommendation below that says a clinical trial is planned - can you tell me more about that?

As you can imagine, we are all flat out on the vaccine development pathway!


Francis


The use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to prevent SARS-CoV2 (Polio Eradication Campaign)


There is no evidence that oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus.

A clinical trial addressing this question is planned in the USA, and WHO will
evaluate the evidence when it is available.


In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend OPV vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend OPV as part of essential immunization services to prevent poliomyelitis and as part of global polio eradication efforts.


There are experimental signals from various studies over the years that OPV has non-specific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well characterized and their clinical relevance is unknown.Such non-specific effects may

not be limited to OPV,as other live vaccines have also been associated with non­ specific protective effects (such as BCG vaccine against tuberculosis). Nonlive vaccines in contrast do not seem to have the same effects.

The exact mechanism of non-specific protection induced by live vaccines needs to be elucidated further. Clinical studies could begin immediately because the vaccines in question are licensed and have an excellent safety record. Clinical tria ls involving off-label use of various drugs licensed for other indications are currently underway. The existing scientific rationale suggests that the same should be done for OPV and other live vaccines. A study is currently being discussed with various
partners and vaccine manufacturers, including the US FDA, the outcomes of which
will be carefully assessed to determine potential use in the context of the spread of SARS-CoV2 until the time when specific vaccines and antiviral therapies are ready.

Dear Dr. Kaldec,


I have not heard from you in over a week. You mentioned getting back to me in a day or two. lime is passing. I am asking you to look at OPV 1 plus 3 serotypes as a bivalent, completely safe vaccine with powerful stimulation of innate immunity lasting several weeks, which can be given a second or third time,and with a historical track record of

preventing other infections from entirely different RNA viruses (such as protecting against influenza). Therefore, it should be really helpful for some months, and Ithink get us past a second wave of SARS-CoV-2,
 and help people return to work safely. I don't understand delays or apparent lack of interest. Who can possibly be against this? If you hear of hypothetical problems we can show you that these are false.Just ask the questions, and we can give you the evidence.

However, no answer from you suggests no  interest and must quickly make alternative  pathways. I am though quite surprised and fear you are receiving "fake news" if you will pardon the expression. Some have been against this who defend their old and failed position on polio eradication with their  promotion of the use of the inactivated  polio virus vaccine. Please note that in the US between 1962 and 1985 we received (safely) the oral polio (OPV). Moreover, if vaccinated already there has not been a single case of a complication and BILLIONS have received it. No it will not last long as innate immunity is short lived, but we strongly believe that we can break the back of the SARS-CoVID-2 spread. Also note that this is what Bill Gates is doing now in India and much of the Eastern hemisphere.

There are countries outside the US wanting to move fast on this. We are waiting for your reply.

As the research community responds to the global challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,HIV prevention science matters as much as ever. Our priority as organizers of the HIV Research for Prevention (HIVR4P) conference remains the safety and wellbeing of all participants.

After careful consideration, we have decided to postpone the HIVR4P conference to 17·21 January
2021. Updated details for the session(s) are listed below :

Session title:HIV prevention 2020 -Where are we now and where are we going?Session type:Opening plenarySuggested presentation
title/topic:Much accomplished ; Much to do -An overview on HIV
prevention researchSession description:Today's plenary sets the stage for the conference week ahead, outlining the big-picture challenges we face in research, product
development and access to prevention.Speakers will provide diverse perspectives on the state of the field today , the opportunities and obstacles ahead and priorities for action
moving forward.Session date and time:Monday, 18 Janua ry 2021·16:00-18:00
Meet the Experts lunches
We invite you to host an informal table discussion at a Meet the Experts lunch on 20 January 2021,
12:00-13:00. Daily meet the experts lunches provide early-career investigators and community advocates
with valuable opportunities for informal, in-depth exchange with experts representing a cross-section of research issues, implementation challenges and HIV-affected communities.

Please reply to this email by Wednesday, 6 May if you are still available to deliver this important presentation and,if so, please also include a photo and a brief biography.

We are acutely aware many researchers and research organizations with critical studies and submissions to HIVR4P are now also heavily engaged in the COVID-19 response. Our hope is that postponing the conference, rather than presenting it virtually in October, will allow for the broadest participation to foster knowledge-exchange , debate and direction-setting in the field of HIV prevention research that HIVR4P is known for.

Thank you for your consideration.

From the Neighborhood
by Frank Derosa



Frank DeRosa retired as Assoc iate Publisher of The Tablet and director of the Diocesan Public Information Office in 2008









When Isee Dr. Anthony Fauci on the TV screen explaining expertly
everything we need to know about the coronavirus pandemic, I find myself thinking back to his father, Stephen Fauci, whose drugstore our family relied on back in the 1950s.
Steve Fauci was the neighborhood pharmacist. The Fauci Pharmacy stood on the southwest
corner of 13 th Ave. and 83 rd St., in the Dyker
Heights section of Brooklyn, diagonally across from the Shrine Church of St. Bernadette. We lived two blocks away on 85 th .



Long ago parishioners like me remember what the store looked like, the
soda fountain that ran along the right wall, the telephone booths at the left close to the entrance and the counter straight ahead down the center.
Whenever my mother sent me there, Mr. Fauci would be behind the
counter, but it was a family enterprise. They lived in an apartment above the store, and if the patriarch wasn't serving you, his wife, Eugenia, or daughter, Denise, was there. Young Anthony, I've since learned, pitched in too, his father sending him out on his bike to deliver items to customers.


I've never met the man who has become the
most important medical voice in the country. Nor have former parishioners that I've spoken to about him in recent days, like boyhood pals Anthony LoFrisco, from
80th St., now in Connecticut, and Bob Orlando, who lived on 84th, now a New Jersey resident, as well as Bishop Gerald Barbarito of the Palm Beach Diocese, from 11th Ave. But each remembers the pharmacy as a Dyker Heights institution.


While we don't know him personally, in a sense he's become everyone's
friend. With his steady television presence, he's imparted his vast knowledge and straightforward advice in a trademark, sometimes gravelly or raspy, Brooklyn accent that has endeared him to people far and wide. You can't be anything but proud of someone of his prominence who came from the parish.


Anthony became known as Tony, as he tells it, when Father Flanagan,
principal of Regis High School, decided to call him that on his first day as a freshman. The name stuck.
Tony took buses and trains to the Jesuit school
in Manhattan, including the old Sea Beach Express. He traveled 70 minutes each way, did three hours of homework, captained the basketball team and excelled in the classroom.


I remember hearing that when Tony was a high schooler, he had a part-
time job working in St. Bernadette's rectory, answering the phone and doing whatever else parishioners wanted him to do to put them in touch with one of the parish priests. In those days, the rectory had a priestly bonanza. There


were four of them.


Because St. Bernadette's School had not yet been established, Tony went to Our Lady of Guadalupe School, where he was taught by Dominican Sisters. It was, and is, St. Bernadette's neighboring parish.


Like most kids, he loved sports. He played CYO baseball and basketball. At Dyker Park on 86th St., he and his friends developed skills in imitation of their heroes. A Yankee follower
living in the midst of Brooklyn Dodgers fans who
adored The Boys of Summer, he's said his favorite players were Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle.


Tony's father and mother married at 18, after they graduated from New
Utrecht High School. Steve went on to Columbia to study pharmacy.
Sometime after he opened his pharmacy, he became friends with Father Al Varriale, one of St. Bernadette's beloved parish priests. At one point, Steve, as a parent, and the priest known
as Father V, who directed the parish's robust CYO sports program for youths, shared a concern. It was the easy availability of indecent


and immoral publications that they knew was a threat to the moral development of young people.
So, with the approval and support of the Diocese of Brooklyn, together they formed a diocesan commission against pornography. Both men are now long gone, and so is the commission, but it was a good idea, though it did not survive them.


Remarkably, just a few houses up the block from where Steve established his pharmacy, lived the Pellegrinos, another family of St. Bernadette's parishioners that produced a renowned medical professional. The eldest son, Edmund, became a bioethicist, a "preeminent" one, as one newspaper described him after he died. But he was more. He helped develop medical programs at Kentucky, Stony Brook and Tennessee Universities. Later, he took on the presidency of The Catholic University of America. Then, after completing his tenure there, he became, as physician and philosopher, the director of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.


Though years apart in age, both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Pellegrino became
Hippocratic stars, nurtured on the same block.


Only in Brooklyn, I say, not without bias.


Steve Fauci was known by members of his extended family and friends for his personality, kindness, sense of humor and wit, and for telling good stories. So they said in comments after he died in 2008.


Tony appears to have inherited Steve's gene for lightheartedness. His
daughter once told the Washington Post that her dad could be a "goofball...he works hard and does his thing, but he comes home and he's singing opera in the kitchen and dancing around."


That kind of calm can help a man maintain his balance as he deals with the pressure of talking to millions of people every day about the complexity of a global pandemic.


As one newsman said, "When Fauci appears on the screen, you turn up the volume."


He once said the Jesuits at Regis and Holy Cross College taught him the
importance of "precision of thought and economy of expression."




That's what he delivers every day: accurate information given concisely.


That's Tony Fauci, now a national treasure. And to think, he came from the neighborhood.








Dr. Anthony Fauci	He graduated from Regis
High School and the College of Holy Cross. He graduated number one in his class at Cornell Medical School in 1966.
He completed his
medical residency at New York Hospital
In 1984, he became director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a position he holds today.

Subject: Another Possible Tool in The Fight Against SARS-CoV-2 ?


Dr. Fauci---Forgive the crude and unsolicited manner in which Iam attempting to reach out to
you but I don't really KNOW any other way !
Iam not a medical doctor nor am I a principle investigator . I am just a Cytologist employed in the Anatomic Pathology department at LA County-USC Medical Center here in Southern California.
But I have been reading a lot--- and in my own exploration I have come across several articles
which suggest the possibility of using a class of agents called
SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE  RECEPTOR AGONISTS in combination with antivirals like oseltamivir  (or perhaps Remdesivir?)  to treat both the viral pathogen responsible for the current pandemic as well as the runaway immune response of the host leading to the oft fatal cytokine  storms.

Apparently these compounds have been approved for flare-ups of multiple sclerosis, and have even been tried on Alzheimer's patients. The commonly known drug is FINGOLIMOD. But these papers that I have cited for you below seem to indicate that structural analogs of this compound could be important in damping down the dysregulated pro-inflammatory cascades which seem to be leading to DIC, alveolar exudates and diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak syndrome and ultimately the multiple organ failure that is killing an unacceptably high number of people.


The fly in the ointment Dr. Fauci here is that these 5-1-PR agonists have only been demonstrated to be effective in non-human primates and other mammals. And much of these studies on these compounds has been done not on coronaviruses but on influenza viruses .
So it would be a gamble. But is that not how we have learned much about human health and
disease is by the gracious sacrifice of our animal cousins? And might it not be a general effect that these sphingosine derivatives have on viral sepsis so that maybe what works for influenza might work for the coronavirus?
In the dire situation that many of the most critically ill COVI D 19 patients find themselves, it
seems they are on the precipice of a rapid demise once they begin to show certain key laboratory results---(spikes in D-DIMER, C-Reactive Protein, Serum Ferritin, prolongation of

prothrombin and APTI, increased cardiactroponin 1, surges in IL-6, IL-7, monocytic and macrophage chemo-attractant cytokines etc).


W ith patients isolated by these aberrant lab values, the window may be narrow but it may be a time where application of antiviral compounds in combination with these inflammatory modulators could have a striking impact on mortality? Indeed maybe even TWO different antivirals with differing mechanisms of action in combination with these Sl-PR Agonists would even be better. And the possibilities of other combinations of course would be there for further exploration .

Fully cognizant of the Hippocratic Oath to 'first do no harm' I still believe that at least the medical rationale is sound for the inclusion of these agents into the possible arsenal of therapeutics for the more severe COVID 19 patients.

Please refer below to the studies Ifound particularly helpful or promising. Perhaps you can put together some 'teams' to further explore investigate these options ??

We all appreciate everything you have done, and continue to do !

Subject: RE: NAS Annual Meeting Session on COVID-19 -- Information regarding your Saturday April 25 participation

Dear all,

Thank you for agreeing to participate in a special late breaking session on the COVID-19 pandemic at the NAS annual meeting. Knowing how busy you are, I am sending this email in l ieu of a call to prepare for the session.

As you know, this is a 90 minute session which aims to provide our audience with deeper insights into the latest developments in the COVID-19 response. I plan to hold an engaging discussion that covers the whole experience on dealing with this pandemic- from US to international, to preparedness  and response , the biology of the vims, the state of diagnostic , treatment   and   vaccine   development,   and   the  importance  of  communication.

I will begin the session by providing  brief (-3 min) opening remarks  describing the circumstances of the pandemic. Then, I will introduce the panelists and you will each have 7 minu tes to provide remarks. You may use a limited number of slides for il1ustration. I hope that each panelist will provide their own perspective and speak to the issues proposed below .

 Jeremy Farrar will discuss the global response to the pandemic, drawing from his experience as a global leader, the chair of the Scientific Advisory Group for the WHO's R&D Blueprint and as a member of the Global Preparedness Monjforing Board.
 Tony Fauci will discuss the US pandemic and provide his perspective as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force addressing the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
 George Gao will discuss China's response to the pandemic and lessons learned for the
rest of the globe.
 Susan Weiss will discuss the viral characteristics of SARS COV2 , insights into its pathobiology, imm1mity and developmen t of a pan-CoV antiviral.
 Richard Hatchett will discuss the development of new vaccines and treatments against
COVID-19 .
 Sanjay Gupta will comment on the health system response to the pandemic and
challenges related to communication and public engagement in responding to COYID-19 .

Following remarks  from  each panelist, we will have a moderated discussion  amongst  ourselves - [ wil I ask you a set of questions  (15 mins) and then we wil I take questions  from the web (25 rnins). To prepare me to be your moderator, please send me any questions you would  like me to ask you. For those of you who would  like to have a prep call, please let me know  and I will set it up.

Best,
Victor

I may have already sent this to you, but I do not think so.  It is short (6 minutes) but it has a segment that shows me 37 years ago.  Yikes!!!  You will get a chuckle.

Thanks for forwarding this very thoughtful document, which presents a series of important recommendations - most of which Iagree with. I don't know if you saw Friday's announcement (attached) of the new public private partnership called ACTIV (for Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines), but it has taken on most of the points you raise in sections 1-3 of your letter. I share your hopes that remdesivir will show benefit, and the current large NIH-sponsored RCT has completed enrollment and should reveal results in about a month. But of course we want to test multiple other interventions- both small molecules and antibody-based therapies, so we need our trial system to be optimized like never before. Iwill share your letter with the leaders of ACTIV, who are working with unprecedented speed to prioritize the next set of therapeutic candidates as wel l as pushing vaccine development programs to adopt exceptionally creative trial designs to test safety and efficacy (with full engagement by FDA).

Dear Francis,


I hope you are well.


I wr ite on behalf of a group of c it izen-scient ists, most or all of whom you know. Motivated solely by our desire to help defeat the serious threat our nation and the world now faces, we wrote a set of four actionable,non-partisan proposa ls (attached) to produce safe and effect ive COVID- 19 therapeut ics and vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to reopen our soc iety in a manner that reduces the risk of future COV ID- 19 outbreaks .

We hope you find these ideas interesting, and might be w illing to share this set of proposa ls with Dr . Tony Fauci, a long with our wil lingness to discuss any part of the proposa ls with him if we can be helpful. We understand from our efforts to contact Dr. Fauci through emai l routes that his standard inbox may be too overwhelmed for our proposa l to reach him.


The four proposals attached descr ibe: (1) How to rapidly repurpose an antiviral drug to treat COV ID-19 patients;(2) How to expedite the development of human antibody drugs to treat patients and to provide short-term protect ion for healthy individua ls;(3) How to develop COV ID-19 vaccines on an exped ited time sca le; and (4) How to reopen our businesses and schools in a manner that reduces the risk of future outbreaks and deaths .

Thank you for any help or thoughts you might be ab le to provide.

Dear Tony,


I have always felt reassured when the good Dr. Fauci speaks, and now more than ever. As an American, a former colleague, a long-time admirer and student of your wisdom -thank you. We are all safer because of you, and the world will be a better place because of
you. Again.


As you know,Iam now leading the ONE Campaign. We've been quite active with the ONEWorld Campaign, dedicated to the fight against this newest virus, and focused on Africa. We've made some progress on debt, and next up is a focus on ensuring that a vaccine, when it comes, is available to everyone.

One of the things we want to do is educate people, in all of the places we work . It won't surprise you that of particular urgency amongst our partners in Africa is that facts and information get to people across the continent, but we also know that more facts are needed everywhere. So next month we are going to launch #PassTheMic, where every day for 19 days we will ask a celebrity to turn his or her social media channels over to an expert on COVID-19 for one day. So Julia Roberts might turn her Twitter account to you to talk about the critical elements needed to flatten the curve and slow the spread. Or Idris Elba could give up his lnstagram to the head of the African CDC so that he can illustrate the impact COVID-19 will have across Africa and what that means for the rest of the world.

We know artists want to be helpful right now, but that it is hard to know what to do. And we know there are experts like you out there who have the answers. We've thought about this a lot at ONE and wanted to do something we felt would truly have an impact. As we look ahead we know COVID-19 does not know borders and until it is beaten everywhere

we are not in the clear. We need a global response plan and we need it now. By turning over their platforms for the day, celebrity influencers will be donating one of their biggest assets - their followers - to YOU, giving you the platform you need (and we all need) to tell the world why a global response is critical. Because none of us are safe until all of us are safe.

We will work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our celebrity partners' audiences - in North America, Europe and Africa, and help create content that both parties are happy with. We are now confirming our talent partners, and so far are getting a terrific response.

We know you're a busy man, so we've planned it so that the amount oftime on your end would be minimal. But the impact would be maximal.

I'm attaching more information about the campaign. Please let me know what you think and if you have questions. Ideally we would like to get this off the ground in early May, so are hoping to confirm folks by April 28th at the latest. Our team will be in touch with your office to follow up.

Thanks as always for everything you do. All my best to you, Gayle

Subjec t:Platelet Donations Down are Down Amid Coronavirus Outbreak -- Please Donate Dear Colleagues:
The NIH Platelet Donor Center has an urgent need for healthy individuals to give lifesaving
platelets to patients. The need for platelet donations is especially acute now with the coronavirus pandemic. While social distancing and increased telework are necessary to contain and slow the spread of coronavirus, we have seen a marked decline in platelet and blood donations for our patients.

To alleviate this shortage, NIAID and the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) are co-sponsoring a two-week Platelet Drive from March 30 -April 10. Platelet collections, as well as whole blood and Double Red Cell donations,can only be made at the NIH Blood Bank on campus in Building 10, Room 1C713 Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. The Platelet Center at Fishers lane is temporarily closed and platelet collections are now on the main campus through at least the next 30 days. This move helps to ensure that blood donors are protected by visitor screening, minimizing possible exposure to individuals at risk.

What is a double red cell donation? A double red cell donation enables donors to donate two units of red blood cells in one visit. During a procedure called apheresis, whole blood is separated through a cell separator and red blood cells are collected.The remainder of the blood components are returned to the donor along with saline to replace the lost volume .

I encourage participation of all employees who are eligible to provide a donation to benefit our NIH patients. Iunderstand employees may be hesitant to participate under the current conditions, but I would like to reassure you that blood donation is a safe process.
Add itional precautions have been put in place at our Bl ood Bank to help prevent the spread of infection and protect the health of donors and staff .

Tha nk you to all who support our quarterly platelet drives. Your efforts provide a lifeline for our patients. Those who participated in the last drive are now eligible to help once again. In appreciation of your dedication to helping others, NIAID grants administrative leave to any NIAID federal employee who donates platelets at the NIH Blood Bank. Specifically, you will be granted 4 hours of administrative leave to be used immediately following your platelet donation appointment . As always with such activities, please notify your supervisor for approval prior to donating at the NIH Platelet Center .. Contractor employees should speak directly to their contract companies to determine what leave

options are available. Please contact the Donor Center at 301-496-4321 to schedule your appointment. let the Donor Center staff know you are with the NIAID Platelet/Double Red Cell Drive. They will answer eligibility questions and provide information about the donation process.


Thank you for consider ing donating during this stressful time. Best regards.



Sincerely,
A.S. Fauci

Bob:
  Please take a look at this. This question evolved from a teleconference that I had 2 nights ago with people "in the t renches" including Alison Arwady (Chicago} . The question is what will be the relationsh ip between the public health workforces at the federal and local levels. Youi had spoken of the CDC people that will be assigned locally and that will help build up a local workforce.
How will CDD interact and relate to the locals. Is there any possibility of Federal funding of their proposal (see attachment).	If not, do you have any suggestions for them?	I can discuss this with you today at the Task Force meeting. Thanks. Best,
Tony

Dear Patty,


Last night on his call with public health leaders from cities across the country, Dr. Fauci asked me to send him/you my follow-up question from Chicago:

How will the necessary public health workforce expansion (e.g.for wide-scale case investigation, contact tracing, linkage to care, commu nity testing, and vaccination) be supported at the federal level?

Our understanding is that state or loca ljurisdictions will be able to develop their own workforces rather than supporting a single workforce at the federal level, and we agree with this approach, but it would be very helpfulto understand next steps and potential time lines, particularly as the reopening drumbeat gets louder.

For example, Chicago has developed a local plan/proposal (attached) that would meet our local needs, help address some of our underlying race and economic equity concerns, and build on our existing community and clinical partnerships. We have shared it with some partners, but it is not at all clear how/whether/when/how much funding might be available. Given the need to quickly expand our workforce and plan ahead, it would be very helpful to get a sense of:

a. How much funding/support might be available, and how that will be determined
b. Whether funding might come through HHS/CDC (our preferred mechanism), FEMA, or another mechanism
c. Will support be available in weeks or months...and for how long-we are strongly advocating
for 5 years, similar to what was done for Ebola
d. Any other information about how our local or state plans need to be adapted to fit into federal thinking on this approach

Thank you so much; Ideeply appreciate Dr. Fauci taking the time to meet with us directly and hear our concerns.

Subject: Notes from call with Dr. Fauci

Hello - Thanks for all for a very informative and sobering discussion last night. I've provided bullets below to capture the main points. Please add or change as needed. I've kept this relatively short but can supply a full recording of the call if you want it.

We will have another call next Tuesday.

David

PPE supplies:
- whi le hospitals are in better shape than a few weeks ago, significant shortages remain at long­ term care facilitates, skilled nursing facilitates , outpatient settings like doctors' offices and urgent care clinics, shelters, prisons. Gowns are the biggest problem, but gloves, masks and shields are also short. Doctors offices are closing for lack of PPE.
- each city is trying to solve these shortages in a short-term, piecemeal way. They need a longer­
term solution to stabilize availability. Outpatient settings are looking to health departments to provide supplies, something HDs are not set up to do.
- testing in most places still requires PPE use (e.g. no availability of anterior nasal swabs) and the
PPE shortages are severely limiting testing scale up.
- even at hospitals , supply limitations make re-opening elective surgeries and other procedures
impossible at this stage.
- Ifconsidering re-opening businesses , this will drastically increase PPE needs to a whole new
sector.

TESTING challenges:
- Each city reported that, despite improvements, a very limited number of tests are being
perfom1ed compared to need.
- Supply shortages are the biggest challenge: swabs, PPE, sample kits, reagents are the biggest obstacles. Not clear where this is going to come from or who is responsible for addressing problems.
- Private labs limit number of sample kits distributed each week. In places where public
labs are available, there is a push to get providers to use the public labs. But many places don't have public labs.
- There is no clear guidance on how to prioritize who gets tested first. So, in some places, that
means that people at lower-risk are being testing but people at greater risk (due to symptoms,

exposure , high-risk living/work environment, etc) are not being testing. Guidelines are needed
to help prioritize where testing resources are used first.
- Public testing produces skewed results. Testing becomes available only to those who can make an appointment and who can drive to the site. This means many lower­ priority people get tested but high-priority people do not. This skews understanding of positivityrates.
- Some labs are underutilized - but the reason is that there are breakdowns in the supply chain
that make it difficult to test people and get tests to the labs. (e.g.)	(b  (4

- Reimbursement is an obstacle. CMS offering to cover test costs ($100 per test) would help get
labs to do more testing. It would not solve the problem , but it would help.
- Proliferation of w1Validated antibody tests is causing confusion. High rates of false results, misinterpretation of what results mean (e.g. telling people who test antibody positive that they must quarantine for two weeks). Chicago spends a lot time shutting down these testing sites as they make th ings harder and use up supplies.
- there is increasing pressure to reach a target number of tests performed each day in order to get to 're-opening'. But the number needed is contextual based on the environment , population - there isn't one 'right' number for everywhere.
- Need better public messaging on difference between virology and serologic tests.
- Current testing capacity is no where near what is needed to make informed decisions about re-
operung.


TESTING: repo1ting challenges
- Ctment Poe tests have no link to provide results to health departments. Many outpatient facilities and SNFs have no system for reporting test results to .I-IDs. Need electronic link for reporting PoC test results.
- While aggregate positive tests may be reported, negative results are not.
- Impossible to reaJJy understand population levels of infection becau se (l) number of tests perfom1ed is too low and (2) not testing the 'right' people
- Every one is pushing for rapid scale up of antibody tests, but we still don't know what the results of these tests mean and how to apply them to policy development.
- CDC and NIH will each coordinate sero-surveys. No details on CDC approach yet. NIH study is up. Still not clear how to use the results of these studies, but useful to collect data now and apply it as knowledge grows. Locally-coordinate aero-surveys can be helpful but only if tests are highly validated.

The Future:
- How many tests should we being doing? How much PPB/testings/beds/staff will be needed in the coming year? Next winter, we will face dual flu and COVID outbreaks, without stable testing capacity, how will we differentiate between the two?
- What are the plans for contact tracing? Who will recruit and train? Is there a federal plan or
guidelines for this? How will it be paid for? What do we do to effectively isolate those infected?

Hi Dr. Fauci,


Please find attached for your review a draft press release describing the launch of the ACTG hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin  study for COVID-19. NIAID will issue the release after the first participant(s ) has enrolled, which is currently anticipated  around  May 1.

The following is the quote we have drafted for you:


"We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Repurposing existing drugs is an attractive option because these medications have undergone extensive testing, allowing them to move quickly into clinical trials and accelerating their potential approval for COVID-19 treatment," said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. "Although there is anecdotal evidence

that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes."


Thanks much,
Kathy

Good afternoon Dr Fauci,

We are interested in seeing if you would be available for a chat via Zoom to New Zealand about COVID-19

The US is an essential part of the NZ economy contributing  between $l .5 and $2 billion dollars annually from tourism alone and we would love to have a conversation about where the US is at, how COVID-19 is being dealt with, and the future of things that could lead up to opening our borders again.

We're happy to have you for any length of time, but if you have 10-20 minutes that would be amazing.

Thank you for what you are doing in this global event, Ihope we can connect
sometime soon Sincerely,
Pat Brittenden

Hi Tony,


This is Lou lgnarro from UCLA. You and I shared the stage in the "Shoe" at the Ohio State University a few years ago, where you gave the Graduation Address to the undergraduate seniors. Iwas on stage with you, to receive an award for my basic biomedical research which resulted in my being awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1998. I recall the nice conversations we were enjoying with Sanjay Gupta while robing for the event.

Thanks for the truly spectacular job you are doing, regarding the coronavirus pandemic. We Nobel Laureates especially regard your work as the most important during our lifetime. Thank you and God bless.

My best wishes,


Lou lgnarro

Dear Dr. Fauci -- many thanks for your time today; we are thrilled to have you as part of the
TIME 100 Talks, which will go live tomorrow.


In the meantime, Iwanted to double check the reference to the study you mentioned about the
east and west coast strains and their potential difference in virulence . Realize it's preliminary, so just wanted to confirm any references we make to it. I checked the biorxiv and medrxiv but didn't find the citation. Would appreciate the journal if it was published. Many thanks! Alice

Jennifer & Courtney-


Hello! Our friends from Steph Curry's team passed along you r contact information to us
and we work at CAA whe re we represent Wor ld Ser ies Champion ,Ryan Zi mmerman.

Ryan wanted to express his grat itude first & foremost to Dr. Fauci,the entire team and all
those behind the scenes working around the clock.


Ryan recently launched the Pros for Heroes Covid-19 Fund last week, with more than 30 professiona l athletes suppo rting and over $300,000 raised across 1,400 separate donat ions. (>www .prosforheroes.org<}.  Since its launch last Tuesday, contribut ions from the Pros For Heroes Fund have gone directly :owards PPE needs throughout the Inova hospital network throughout the mid-Atla ntic and have helped provide meals to those critical care front-line workers - keeping these front-line heroes covered at work and comfortable at home.

If Dr. Fauci was up to it,Ryan would love to host either a short 15 minute Q&A on his Facebook to contin ue raising awareness for how we need to be responding to the ongoing crisis. Or even simply thank Dr. Fauci for the tireless work he is doing and shine a light on how folks ca n support these critical frontline workers.

We a re also open to what you think would work best!  Wou ld there any openings that would work  best?

We know Dr. Fauci is big baseba ll fan, and of course we are all huge fans of his !  If we can ever be suppo rtive or help navigate anything in the world of pop culture, please do not hesitate to ask.

Warmest wishes,

Coronavirus's ability to mutate has been vastly underestimated, and mutations affect deadliness of strains, Chinese study finds

 The most aggressive strains of Sars-CoV-2 could generate 270 times as much viral load as the
least potent type
 New York may have a deadlier strain imported from Europe, compared to less deadly viruses elsewhere in the United States

A new study by one of China's top scientists has found the ability of the new coronavirus to mutate has been vastly underestimated and different strains may account for different impacts of the disease in various parts of the wor ld.
Professor Li Lanjuan and her colleagues from Zhejiang University found within a small pool of patients many mutations not previously reported. These mutations included changes so rare that scientists had never considered they might occur.
They also confirmed for the first time with laboratory evidence that certain mutations could create strains deadlier than others.
"Sars-CoV-2 has acquired mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity," Li and her collaborators wrote in a non-peer reviewed paper released on preprint service medRxiv.org on Sunday. Li's study provided the first hard evidence that mutation could affect how severely the virus caused disease or damage in its host.
Li took an unusual approach to investigate the virus mutation. She analysed the viral strains isolated
from 11randomly chosen Covid-19 patients from Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhej iang, and then tested how efficiently they could infect and kill cells.
The deadliest mutations in the Zhejiang patients had also been found in most patients across Europe, while the milder strains were the predominant varieties found in parts of the United States, such as Washington state, according to their paper.
A separate study had found that New York strains had been imported from Europe.The death rate in
New York was similar to that in many European countries, if not worse.
But the weaker mutation did not mean a lower risk for everybody, according to Li's study. In Zhejiang, two patients in their 30s and SOs who contracted the weaker strain became severely ill. Although both survived in the end, the elder patient needed treatment in an intensive care unit.
This finding could shed light on differences in regional mortality. The pandemic's infection and death
rates vary from one country to another, and many explanations have been proposed.
Genetic scientists had noticed that the dominant strains in different geographic regions were inherently different. Some researchers suspected the varying mortality rates could, in part, be caused by mutations but they had no direct proof.

The issue was further complicated because surviva l rates depended on many factors, such as age, underlying health conditions or even blood type.
In hospitals, Covid-19 has been treated as one disease and patients have received the same treatment
regardless of the strain they have. Li and her colleagues suggested that defining mutations in a region
might determine actions to fight the virus .
"Drug and vaccine development,while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations
... into account to avoid potential pitfalls," they said.
Li was the first scientist to propose the Wuhan lockdown,accord ing to state media reports. The government followed her advice and in late January, the city of more than 11million residents was shut down  overnight
The sample size in this most recent study was remarkably small. Other studies tracking the virus
mutation usually involved hundreds, or even thousands, of strains.
Li's team detected more than 30 mutations . Among them 19 mutations - or about 60 per cent - were
new.
They found some of these mutations could lead to functional changes in the virus' spike protein, a unique structure over the viral envelope enabling the coronavir us to bind with human cells. Computer simulation predicted that these mutations would increase its infectivity.
To verify the theory, Li and colleagues infected cells with strains carrying different mutations.The most
aggressive strains could generate 270 times as much viral load as the weakest type. These strains also
killed the cells the fastest.
It was an unexpected result from fewer than a dozen patients, "indicating that the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely underappreciated," Li wrote in the paper.

The mutations were genes different from the earliest strain isolated in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in late December last year.
The coronavirus changes at an average speed of about one mutation per month. By Monday, more than 10,000 strains had been sequenced by scientists around the globe, containing more than 4,300 mutations, according to the China National Centre for Bioinformation.
Most of these samples, though, were sequenced by a standard approach that could generate a result quickly.The genes were read just once, for instance, and there was room for mistakes.

Li's team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building block of the virus genome was read more than 100 times,allowing the researchers to see changes that could have been overlooked by the conventional approach.
The researchers also found three consecutive changes - known as tri-nucleotide mutations - in a 60- year-old patient, which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time. This patient spent more than SO days in hospital, much longer than other Covid-19 patients, and even his faeces were infectious with living viral strains.
"Investigating the functional impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting," Li and colleagues said in the paper.
Professor Zhang Xuegong, head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective
strategy to track the virus' mutation.
"It can produce some useful information," he said.
But this approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all samples.
"Our understanding of the virus remains quite shallow," Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectable symptoms in many others still left scientists scratching their heads.
"If there is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don't be surprised."

Dear Francis,
Congratulations on your launch of Public Private Partnership to speed COVID 19 vaccine and treatment options. This is very timely and much needed. Kudos to your leadership.
Iam sure you are aware of a global coordinating effort to accelerate vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. I have been part of the conversation and planning along with Jeremy Farrar, Richard Hatchett, Seth Berkley, Chris Elias, Paul Stoffels etc. Recently WHO, Gates Foundation and European Commission have been leading the planning. This has advanced rapidly and is in the final stages in development that will be soon announced. It has involved European Commission, Germany, Japan, UK, Norway, France, Saudi as well as Gates Foundation, WHO, World Bank, Wellcome Trust, GAVI, Global Fund, CEPI, GPMB and private sector industry. The initiative will begin with a Pledge conference for $8B as a starting point. This will be led by President von der Leyen and is co-chaired by the above country leaders. This will occur on May 4. In addition by the end of this week or early next week there will be an announcement on the global coordinating structure with will involve Gates, WHO etc.
Iam writing to be sure that you and the White House are aware of these upcoming events. Can you share this information with the White House? Besides you, who else should I share this information with? Iwill be happy to send you background documents if you wish.
Please call me anytime. Best,
Victor

Dear Tony,


You may remember, that we have met repeatedly and worked in parallel and in association, during the early years of the HIV epidemic.

You and I have been trained in immunoly. Both of us are much sollicitated to help facing and fighting the covid-19 epidemic.

During the past years, as well as recently, Ihave followed with great interest and respect your accomplishments and your advices in the fights against epidemics. I would be extremely grateful to you if you can provide me with the most recent and pertinent scientific and population data concerning covid-19. Iknow how extremely busy you are but maybe a collaborator of yours whether he can send me the data via e-mail	(b)(6) This will allow me to give more
documented informations to the French President and Government. Cooperation between countries will be crucial against covid-19 as it has been against HIV and other agents.

I look forward to seeing you again in quieter times .
Many thanks and very best personal regards.

Rick Bright HHS
WASHINGTON - Rick Bright, one of the nation's leading vaccine development experts and the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, is no longer leading the organization, officials told STAT.
The shakeup at the agency, known as BARDA, couldn't come at a more inopportune time for the office,
which invests in drugs, devices, and other technologies that help address infectious disease outbreaks and which has been at the center of the government's coronaviru s pandemic response.
Bright, whose departure was confirmed by three industry sources and two current Trump administration sources, will instead move into a narrower role at the National Institutes of Health overseeing a similar but limited public-pri vate partnership ai med at vaccine development. Gary Disbrow, Bright's former deputy at BARDA, will serve as the acting director of the office, an HHS spokesperson confirmed to
STAT.
BARDA was expected to play an even larger role in the coming months; Congress more than tripled BARDA's budget in the most recent coronavirus stimulus package.Already, the office has a role in some of the splashiest Covid-19 projects, including partnerships with Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Therapeut ics, both of which are developing potential Covid-19 treatments .
Related:
This tiny federal agency was built to respond to a crisis like coronavirus. Now that it's here, is BARDA ready?
BARDA has been plagued with management issues virtually since its creation in 2006, with much of the
criticism aimed at a contracting department that some say is unresponsive to industry partners. The office has only had two permanent directors since its creation in 2006. Bright has led the organization since 2016.
None of the sources articulated the reason for Bright's departure, though several mentioned recent chafing between Bright and Bob Kadlec, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, which has oversight over BARDA.
An HHS spokesperson confirmed that Bright will work on a recently announced NIH public-private
partnership with 16 drug makers aimed at develop ing vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.
"Dr. Rick Bright will transfer the skills he has applied as Director of the [BARDA] to the [NIH].... Dr. Bright brings extensive experience and expertise in facilitating powerful public-private partnerships that advance the health and well-being of the American people," the spokesperson said.
Bright did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bright's career has largely centered around vaccine and drug development . His work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focused on influenza viruses, antiviral drugs and tests. He has also worked in the biotechnology industry and served as an advisor to the World Health Organization. Before becoming BARDA director, he led the agency's Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division.

Jennifer & Courtney-


Hello! Our friends from Steph Curry's team passed a long your contact information to us and we work at
CAA where we represent Wor ld Series Champion, Ryan Zimme rman.

Ryan wanted to express his gratitude first & foremost to Dr. Fauci, the entire team and a ll those behind the scenes work ing around the clock.

Ryan recently launched the Pros for Heroes Covid-19 Fund last week, with more than 30 professional athletes supporting and over $300,000 raised across 1,400 separate donat ions. (www.prosforheroes.org).  Since its launch last Tuesday, contributions from the Pros For Heroes Fund have gone directly towards PPE needs throughout the Inova hospital network throughout the mid­ Atlantic and have helped provide mea ls to those criticalcare front-line workers - keeping these front-line heroes covered at work and comfortab eat home.

If Or . Fauci was up to it, Ryan would love to host either a short 15 minute Q&A on his Facebook to continue raising awareness for how we need to be responding to the ongoing crisis. Or even simply thank Dr. Fauci for the tireless work he is doirg a nd shine a light on how folks can support these critical frontline workers.

We are also open to what you think wou ld work best! Would there any openings that would work best?


We know Dr. Fauci is big baseball fan, and of course we are a ll huge fans of his!  If we can ever be
supportive or help navigate anything in the world of pop culture, please do not hesitate to ask. Warmest wishes,
J udee Ann

HI Alice - thanks for sending this along. We will confer about how best to handle media requests about the guidelines - we're calling them NIH guidelines and the press release came from NIH, so I'd like to involve the NIH media office in this, hence I've cc'd Renate Myles.  Ithink it's sort of an unsettled question as to who the spokespeople will be. Drs. Lane and Masur
- do you have a preference?


Also, who is Claire?  (The person who forwarded the CNN request to you and Dr. Masur. Would be good to have a last name so we can confer with her as needed going forward.)

Coronavirus's ability to mutate has been vastly underestimated, and mutations affect deadliness of strains, Chinese study finds

 The most aggressive strains of Sars-CoV-2 could generate 270 times as much viral load as the
least potent type
 New York may have a deadlier strain imported from Europe, compared to less deadly vi'ruses elsewhere in the United States

A new study by one of China's top scientists has found the ability of the new coronavirus to mutate has been vastly underestimated and different strains may account for different impacts of the disease in various parts of the wor ld.
Professor Li Lanjuan and her colleagues from Zhejiang University found within a small pool of patients many mutations not previously reported.These mutations included changes so rare that scientists had never considered they might occur.
They also confirmed for the first time with laboratory evidence that certain mutations could create strains deadlier than others.
"Sars-CoV-2 has acquired mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity," Li and her collaborators wrote in a non-peer reviewed paper released on preprint service medRxiv.org on Sunday. Li's study provided the first hard evidence that mutation could affect how severely the virus caused disease or damage in its host.
Li took an unusual approach to investigate the virus mutation.She analysed the viral strains isolated
from 11randomly chosen Covid-19 patients from Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, and
then tested how efficiently they could infect and kill cells.
The deadliest mutations in the Zhejiang patients had also been found in most patients across Europe, while the milder strains were the predomina nt varieties found in parts of the United States,such as Washington state, according to their paper.
A separate study had found that New York stra ins had been imported from Europe. The death rate in
New York was similar to that in many European countries, if not worse.
But the weaker mutation did not mean a lower risk for everybody, according to Li's study. In Zheji ang, two patients in their 30s and 50s who contracted the weaker strain became severely ill. Although both survived in the end, the elder patient needed treatment in an intensive care unit.
This finding could shed light on differences in regiona l mortality.The pandemic's infection and death
rates vary from one country to another,and many ex planations have been proposed.
Genetic scientists had noticed that the dominant strains in different geographic regions were inherently different. Some researchers suspected the varying mortality rates could, in part, be caused by mutations but they had no direct proof.
The issue was f urther complicated because survival rates depended on many factors, such as age,
underlying health conditions or even blood type.
In hospitals, Covid-19 has been treated as one disease and patients have received the same treatment regardless of the strain they have. Li and her colleagues suggested that defining mutations in a region might determine actions to fight the virus .
"Drug and vaccine development, while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations
... into account to avoid potential pitfalls," they said.

Li was the first scientist to propose the Wuhan lockdown,accordi.ng to state media reports. The government followed her advice and in late January, the city of more than 11million residents was shut down overnight.
The sample size in this most recent study was remarkably small. Other studies tracking the virus mutation usually involved hundreds, or even thousands, of strains.
Li's team detected more than 30 mutations. Among them 19 mutations - or about 60 per cent - were new.
They found some of these mutations could lead to functional changes in the virus' spike protein, a unique structure over the viral envelope enabling the coronavir us to bind with human cells. Computer simulation predicted that these mutations would increase its infectivity.
To verify the theory, Li and colleagues infected cells with strains carrying different mutations. The most
aggressive strains could generate 270 times as much viral load as the weakest type. These strains also killed the cells the fastest.
It was an unexpected result from fewer than a dozen patients, "indicating that the true diversity of the
viral strains is still largely underappreciated," Li wrote in the paper.

The mutations were genes different from the earliest strain isolated in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in late December last year.
The coronavirus changes at an average speed of about one mutation per month. By Monday, more than 10,000 strains had been sequenced by scientists around the globe, containing more than 4,300 mutations, according to the China National Centre for Bioinformation .
Most of these samples, though, were sequenced by a standard approach that could generate a result quickly. The genes were read just once, for instance, and there was room for mistakes.
Li's team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building block of the virus genome was read more than 100 times, allowing the researchers to see changes that could have been overlooked by the conventional approach.
The researchers also found three consecut ive changes - known as tri-nucleotide mutations- in a 60- year-old patient,which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time.This patient spent more than 50 days in hospital, much longer than other Covid-19 patients,and even his faeces were infectious with living viral strains.

"Investigating the functional impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting," Li and colleagues said in the paper.
Professor Zhang Xuegong, head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective
strategy to track the virus' mutation.
"It can produce some useful information," he said.
But this approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all samples.
"Our understanding of the virus remains quite shallow," Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectable symptoms in many others still left scientists scratching their heads.
"If there is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don't be surprised."

Tony . I hope your mail box is not so full that there is room for this. A group of concerned scientists from different par!s of the country was organized to try to encapsulate and focus tbe national effott against Covid. This document has been shared with the White House althottgh we are not sure if it has had any effect on their plans . It has also been shared with The Gates Foundation and a tew other business and academic leaders. We think we have been fairly comprehensive in our considerations and recommendations. I hope you will find this helpfol. We would greatly appreciate a conversation with you after you have had an oppo1tunity to digest the content of the proposal. If there is anything else we can do to help you in this National emergency, we stand ready to help. When I was at Merck ,we led the successful
effort to make HIV a manageable disease and we dramatically lowered the death rate as a result of the drngs we
made ,and the first triple therapy trial during the HIV pandemic . We hope we can help do the same for The Covid Pandemic  Best wishes  Ed scolnick

Subject: A National Testing Action Plan by the Rockefeller Foundation: Embargoed till midnight Monday
April 20


Dear Tony:
--	--




remember me	CbH
we talked a lot when l was at CNN. I have not

wanted to bother you but wanted to make sure you had the National Testing Action Plan that we
have put together with top researcher s from all the various roadmaps , etc. Ijoined The Rockefeller Foundation after working in Afghanistan and Pakistan with State and coerced Christy Feig to join me.  We would be happy to get on a call today with Raj and Jonathan Quick
and other authors like Mike Pellini and Mark McLellan and Rick Klau sner.

Given our history with public health and our ability to convene, we hoped we could help by working out a consensus plan.Ihave been briefing Caleb McCarry at the White House. We have worked with industry to also figure out the solutions to the supply chain issues and the

other logistical issues. We are going to put $10 million into helping this standup. This plan doesn't just say what we need but the steps to get it done to open more safely.

Please let me know if you would like a call.

Regards
Eileen

You have an interview today with Jack Curry of the YES Network (Yankees) . Just last night, The NY Post ran a story that includes Jack among the many sports broadcasting stars that have come out of Fordha	CbH ; Jack and I have
talked about this) . Thought you might like to see it. Parts of your interview are also going to
run on Michael Kay's show, and Kay also features prominently in this piece.






How Fordham has produced a generation of sports media stars

April 19, 2020 I 4:04pm  I Updated April 19, 2020 I 9:16pm



John Giannone, Michael Kay and Mike Breen; Chris Carrino Courtesy of Michael Kay, Chris Carrino

Long before he was an electee to the Basketball Hall of Fame, Mike Breen was an intimidated 18-year-old freshman attending a workshop at Fordham' s renowned college radio station, WFUV, in the fall of 1979.

Breen felt sheepish next to the juniors and seniors leading the seminar and contemplated  delaying the start of his broadcasting training. Soon, a couple of upperclassmen, including future NBA writer Dave D'Alesandro, made him feel more comfortable.

But he still didn't have any friends until one day on campus he saw a confident sophomore trying
to sweet talk a young woman. "I know you like me," he said. "I can see it in your eyes."

The woman responded by saying she would not date him if he were the last man on earth. She essentially was saying, "See ya" . .. to Michael Kay .

That is how Breen first became friends with Kay .

"For him to have the confidence to do this in front of everybody with this beautiful student, I thought , 'Man, this guy has a great sense of humor,"' Breen said.

Four decades later, Breen and Kay are still good friends.



Michael Kay and Mike Breen Courtesy of Michael Kay

Fordham, the private Jesuit university in The Bronx that launched the legendary Vin Scully, for decades has been a powerhouse sportscasting pipeline, especially in New York. And the school ties that first united Breen and Kay are webbed throughout the industry.

Fordham is the alma mater for the voice of the NBA Finals/Knicks (Breen, Class of 1983), the Yankees' lead TV play-by-player/ESPN  New York afternoon radio host (Kay, '82), the voice of the Giants (Bob Papa, '86), the radio voice of the Nets (Chris Carrino, '92) MSG's John Giannone  ('86), YES'  Jack Curry ('86), WFAN's  PaulDottino  ('86) and YES/ESPN's  Ryan Ruocco ('08). And that's just New York-based  sportscasters.

For good measure, the school produced  CBS' Spero Dedes ('01), ESPN's Tony Reali ('00) and the Washington Nationals'  Charlie Slowes ('83). There are many more, and not just  in front of the camera. Ifyou need a field producer, Jim Johnson ('86) works for ESPN. A radio engineer? WFAN's Chris Majkowski ('89) will set things up. Media relations? Louis Bafficelli ('09) is leading things at MLB Network.

Like everyone else, they are all dealing with the halt of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It is a jaffing timeout for people so used to being on the run.

Take Carrino, who has done so much to raise money and awareness for facio scapulo humeral dystrophy (FSHD), a form of muscular dystrophy that afflicts him. A fundraising event was supposed to take place in March at a Nets game at Barclays Center. His  10th annu al fundraising dinner, correspond ing with his 50th bi1thday, was slated for August, and now is in question .

"I don't know if it is going to be safe to have people together still," Carrino said. "Are the restrictions going to be there in terms of how many people can gather in one place? The other aspect of it for me is: How comfortable am I asking people for money when I know the economy and certain businesses are affected so badly?"

Ruocco was supposed to get married in Italy in June. He and his fiancee, Andrea Ferzoco, are now going to punt the wedding until June 2021.

"It sucks,"Ruocco said. "Andrea and I were so excited and so were our guests. We have been feeling all the joy leading us to this. There are people dealing with much more dire circumstances than rescheduling a wedding. That is kind of the perspective we have tried to take."

While most of the successfu l sports media alumni are worried about the current direction of Fordham and WFUV because of a de-emphasis on sports during the pandem ic, to a man they say how Fordham molded them and led them to where they are today.

They were helped by famous names such as the legendary Marty Glickman, a mentor , and Stan Fischler, who taught classes. Then there were the less famous, equally instnunenta l figures in the program, such as Bob Ahrens, who ran WFUV as its executive producer during many of these notable students' formative years.



John Giannone punting at FordhamCourtesy of John Giannone

The experiences that they shared forged many of them, such as Breen and Kay, into close friends.

Giannone went to Fordham after being recruited to be a punter on the football team. Dming training camp his freshman year, he quickly figured out the third-string punter would never see the field. He went to Kay, then the WFUV sports director as a senior, to try to help on the station. Kay said Giannone could do stats for him during the football season.

Kay went on to work at The Post, and later helped Giannone land an entry-level position at the paper. When Giannone transferred  into television at CNN/Sports Illustrated, it was through a Kay connection. And Giannone landed at MSG Network after Kay left to become the TV voice of the Yankees when YES Network began.

When it was Giannone's turn as WFUV sports director, he made Papa and Curry a play-by­ player and an analyst when they were sophomores.

WFUV also got its staff access to locker rooms at places like Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden to learn the craft next to professionals at the highest level. That remains largely true today.

"WFUV allowed you to believe you were a professional broadcaster before you really were," Curry said. "We were in the heart of New York City, and, even if we weren't Marv Albert, we felt as if what Marv Albert was doing for the Knicks, we were doing for Fordham."

There is a lineage that unites. Carrino learned how to describe the geography of a basketball court from Glickman. Later, Carrino returned to Fordham and taught Ruocco the same lessons. These days, at some Nets games, Ruocco is on TV, sitting next to Carrino, calling the game on the radio.



Jack Curry Courtesy of Jack Curry

Papa also was mentored by Glickman. Papa and Carrino each were told by their fathers that if they majored in communications, they would have to pay for school themselves. Both ended up in the Business School, but had their eyes on WFUV the whole time.

Carrino ended up working as a producer for Papa, beginning when Papa hosted a tailgate show
on WFAN. Carrino eventually followed Papa as the radio voice of the Nets.

The Fordham sports alums want everyone to be safe during this time -and they can't wait to
get back to what they love to do.

"I'm desperate to get back to work," Breen said. "I'm hoping there is NBA basketball. This is the best time of the year."

Here is the  working draft of the article for the NEJM . It, in my opinion, reads really well . I have embellished  it today with a figure that conceptually outlines what we are talking about; the old axiom that a picture is worth a thousand words .
The editorial guidelines of the NEJM  has 2 potential categories. One is Perspectives  which is 1200 words   an 5 references  . We  are at 1750 words   and  Ithink losing 500 words  takes  away a lot from the message  .The other category is a special report which is over 2500 words  and allows lots of references  ( 40) I think this is best and was one reason I thought  about adding the conceptua l figure   which  does  outline  in a single  picture what we are talking about  .

Tony, If you feel its best to have  Francis   on this paper we  both support it . Your call  . I do however
lean on including Francis .Iwould say politicly  to achieve our goal and bring all these companies into the tent while you are away at the White House having him buy into this plan through the ACTIV program seems important to us . Ithink we get to our goal if he is out there publicly embracing this; using the NIAID networks labs DSMB and the correlates programs .This type of granula rity really puts him deep into understanding what we are doing .	If this means you are first and he is last author we are ok with that, For me I need to have him use me for interfacing with the company in defining  these collaborations . If you were present all the time this would be unnecessary , but as he will be the link with BARDA linking him to John and I increases the likelihood of success.

Dear David et al.,


Thanks for forwarding this very thoughtful document, which presents a series of important recommendations - most of which Iagree with. I don't know if you saw Friday's announcement (attached) of the new public private partnership called ACTIV (for Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines), but it has taken on most of the points you raise in sections 1- 3 of your letter. I share
your hopes that remdesivir will show benefit, and the current large NIH-sponsored RCT has completed enrollment and should reveal results in about a month. But of course we want to test multiple other interventions- both small molecules and antibody-based therapies, so we need our trial system to be optimized like never before.  Iwill share your letter with the leaders of ACTIV, who are working with unprecedented speed to prioritize the next set of therapeutic candidates as well as pushing vaccine development programs to adopt exceptionally creative trial designs to test safety and efficacy (with full engagement by FDA).

Best regards, Francis

Dear Francis,

I hope you are well .

I write on behalf of a group of citizen-scientists, most or all of whom you know. Motivated solely by our desire to help defeat the serious threat our nation and the world now faces, we wrote a set of four actionable, non-partisan proposals (attached) to produce safe and effective COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to reopen our society in a manner that reduces the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks.

We hope you find these ideas interesting, and might be willingto share this set of proposals with Dr. Tony Fauci, along with our willingness to discuss any part of the

proposals with him if we can be helpful.  We understand from our efforts to contact Dr. Fauci through email routes that his standard inbox may be too overwhelmed for our proposal to reach him.

The four proposals attached describe: (1) How to rapidly repurpose an antiviral drug to treat COVID- 19 patients; (2) How to expedite the development of human antibody drugs to treat patients and to provide short -term protect ion for healthy individuals; (3) How to develop COVID-19 vaccines on an exped ited time scale; and (4) How to reopen our businesses and schools in a manner that reduces the risk of future outbreaks and deaths.

Thank you for any help or thoughts you might be able to provide.


Sincerely yours,

Dear Patty,


Ihope this finds you well. I know how terribly busy Tony is and Ihate to trouble him,however, the NAS Annual Meeting panel on COVID-19 is less than a week away and my team needs answers to the questions below.Can you call this to his attention or assist him in providing the signed form and requested information? We hope to have this by Tuesday (4/23) morning, if possible.

 Please provide a cell number where you can be reached in case you do not connect in time (if you prefer, you can provide the number of your assistant if they will be able to reach you directly by cell or at home).

 Will you have slides to display during your talk?


 Are you able to use Zoom 'share your screen' to show the slides directly during your talk or do you need someone from NAS to show your slides for you?

 Will you need a test session with our Zoom techs? Please let me know as soon as possible as
staff are available to hold training sessions through Monday,April 20 (9 AM to 5 PM EDT).


 If you would like to promote your participation in our meeting on social media, please let me
know the contact of your social media contact from your institution.


Finally, because this is going to be a remote meeting, we would like panelists to log into Zoom 30 minutes before the session starts- that is at 1:30 pm ET to go over the technology and any last minute speaker prep. So far, more than 800 Academy members have registered for the meeting and there will be additional members of the public and possibly the press tuning in.

Best, Victor

As the Pl of the ROl grant publicly targeted by Fox News reporters at the Presidential press briefing last night, Ijust wanted to say a personal thankyou on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to­ human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology .

From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel

comments are to us all.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA, Gates Foundation, UnitedHealth Group, Quantigen, and U.S. Cotton Collaborate to Address Testing Supply Needs

The U.S.Food and Drug Administration announced a further expansion of COVID-19 testing options through the recognition that spun synthetic swabs - with a design similar to Q-tips - could be used to test patients by collecting a sample from the front of the nose.
As part of this effort, U.S. Cotton, the largest manufacturer of cotton swabs and a subsidiary of Parkdale-Mills,developed a polyester-based Q-tip-type swab that is fully synthetic for compatibility with COVID-19 testing. Harnessing its large-scale U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities, U.S. Cotton plans to produce these new polyester swabs in large quantities to help meet the needs for
coronavirus diagnostic testing.
"This action today demonstrates the ingenuity that results from the FDA work ing in partnership with the private sector .The Trump Administration has been working side-by-side with our industry partners to fight this pandemic, and today is a great example of that work .We appreciate work by UnitedHealth Group, Quantigen, and the Gates Foundation to perform and support the clinical studies necessary for this advancement. We also want to acknowledge U.S. Cotton's efforts to manufacture a new type of swab for COVID-19 testing that can be produced at scale. We appreciate the work of these collaborators to consider how these test supplies could be broadly distributed to meet not only the testing needs of the United States but also global needs around the pandemic. All of these actions by these American organizations will help continue to expand our testing capability," said FDA Comm issioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D.
This finding that spun synthetic swabs could be used for COVID-19 testing is based on results from a
clinical investigation that represents a collaboration between the FDA, UnitedHealth Group,the Gates Foundation, and Quant igen. The type of testing at the front of the nose used in this study is notable because it allows self-collection by patients thereby limiting exposure of healthcare providers; it is more comfortable for patients and it can be performed by a swab that is more readily available and manufacturable at scale.

Jack Curry (broadcaster with the YES Network, which is like MASN,but for the Yankees) is appealing to you as a New Yorker and lifelong Yankees fan for a  10-minute interview via Zoom . Jack covered the Yankees for 22 years at the NYT. The interview would run on YES (largest regional sports network in the country) as the focus of one of the original shows they are producing 3x/week called "YES, WE'RE HERE." It would be run across all of their socia l media platforms (reach of over 1M). They would a lso air clips on the Michael Kay Radio Show (TV play-by-play announcer for the Yankees), which is simulcast on YES and is the highest-rated drive time ta lk show in New York.

Questions below, including a few at the end about your lifelong baseball fandom. Is this something you'd be willing to do? If so we will seek clearance.




POSSIBLE QUESTIONS

        DOCTOR FAUCI, I KNOW YOUR DAYS ARE FILLED WITH OFFERfNG ADVICE AND COUNSEL TO SO MANY PEOPLE ABOUT THE CORONA VIRUS. WTTH THE SOBERING POSITION WE HAVE BEEN lN FOR A WHILE, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR MOST URGENT MESSAGE TO AMERICA   S?

THE PHRASE 'FLATTENING THE CURVE' HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE IN OUR VERNACULAR lN RECENT
WEEKS. HOW MUCH CLOSER ARE WE GETTING TO FLATTENING THE CURVE?

        YOU'VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES THAT Tiffi VIRUS IS THE CLOCK. WHAT IS Tiffi VIRUS TELLING YOU ABOUT THAT TIME FRAME?

        AS THE COUNTRY TRIES TO WORK ITS WAY BACK, THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT HOW PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CAN RETURN. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW, FOR INSTANCE, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WOULD BE ABLE TO START ITS SEASON?

        BASEBALL iS A SPORT 1N WHICH SHAKING HANDS IS AS COMMON AS BALLS A  D STRIKES. NOT JUST IN BASEBALL, OBVIOUSLY, BUT lN LIFE OVERALL, HOW MUCH DO YOU ADVOCATE NOT SHAKI  G HANDS ANYMORE?

        THE NEW YORK TIMES REFERRED TO YOU AS Tl-IE EXPLAlNER-IN·CHIEF IN COMPLIMENTING YOUR ABILITY TO SPEAK BLUNTLY AND TRUTHFULLY. SO HOW SHOULD AMERICANS PLAN ON BEHAVING AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES?


AND ...IF DR FAUCI WAS COMFORTABLE WITH IT, A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BASEBALL
FANDOM ...


         WITH ALL THAT'S HAPPENING  AROUND US A   D YOUR IMPORTANT ROLE TN TT, JT MlGHT SEEM TRITE TO DISCUSS BASEBALL.  BUT I KNOW YOU'VE  BEEN A YANKEE  FAN  FOR MORE THAN 70 YEARS. AND lWOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU  A FEW  BASEBALL QUESTIONS.

WHEN AND HOW DID YOUR YANKEE FANDOM BEGIN?

        YOU WERE A YOUNGSTER WHE   THE YANKEES WON 5 STRAIGHT WORLD SERIES TITLES FROM I949-I953, THE ONLY TIME THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN BASEBALL HISTORY . WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES OF THOSE YEARS?

HOW HAS YOUR BACKGROUND  IN SPORTS HELPED YOU IN YOUR ROLE WITH THE NlAID?


AND, FINALLY, YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT HOW NEW YORK IS THE EPICENTER OF THE VIRUS. FOR NEW
YORKERS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SOME LIGHT AT THEE   D OF TI-IE TUNNEL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?

In looking at NEJM, they have had 4 COIVD-19 perspectives in last 6 weeks, and they may have impacted their thinking.

Agree with talking to editors. If interest in Science or Nature, suggestions below.


Priscilla Kelly, editor at science emailed me a while about their interest in papers. So if interest in Science, we could check with her.
If Nature, Ursula Weiss.

Adrian:
  Thank you for you note. Sorry that I took a few days to get back to you, but I have been swamped.	It is good to know of your work on the chimpanzee adenoviral vectors. The biosafety classification of viral vectors in the U.S. is within the purview of the CDC, and so I have copied CDC Director Bob Redfield on this e­ maii.  He would be able to point you in the right direction.
Best regards,

"I think the time has come, with our models on 260 counties across the country releasing in the next 48 hours, to offer Tony Fauci, and potentially other task force members, a preview of the work.  Our models have incorporated local area differences due to weather, population and social distancing.  They reveal that the large, densely populated cities will struggle to re-open, and are not well aided by weather effects given their density.  However, in less densely populated areas, in which case counts are lower, weather has been a mitigating factor.  These latter counties may

have better success when they re-open assuming they are smart about workplace safety and have
testing and surveillance strategies in place"

Dear Dr. Fauci, dear Dr. Coomes,

thank you for your reply from 13. April with the notice that the information has been shared with NIAID's COVID-19 research team.

Has the project already been initially evaluated by the team? Are there any questions or need for additional information?
 Ihave summed up the relevant data regarding the use of proteasome inhibitors for treatment of COVID-19 patients with acute lung and systemic organ failure in a position paper, please find a Preview draft attached.


 With regard to currently ongoing trials with monoclonal antibodies against the ll-6 receptor, i.e. tocilizumab or sarilumab: These approaches go into the same direction as the present suggestion, however, inhibition of NF-KB by proteasome inhibitors could provide the unique potential to inhibit the release of multiple cytokines simultaneously, in particular strongly pro­ inflammatory cytokines including IL- 1, IL-6, TNFa and chemokines,such as MIP-1and CXCLl.

 This simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemok ine seems to be adva ntegeaus compared to single target approaches (as with the mAb) to compensate for redundant and synergist ic effects of multiple cytokines released during highly pathogenic CoV or HSNl infection.

Looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards,
Ralf

Subject:WG : Inhibit cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients by Velcade Bortezomib
Importance: High


Inhibition of cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrom by PROTEASOME INHIBITORS e.g. Velcade {Bortezomib)
Dear Dr. Fauci,
dear Madams/Sirs,
I want to bring to your attension some potentially important experimental data and a new proposal  for treatment of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure . Sorry for the broad distribution but Iwanted to make sure that my message reaches you.

Similarly as has been described earlier for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV (Cbannappanavar & Perlman , 2017), H5Nl and some heavy HlNl Influenza A infections, also COVID-19 patients have been reported to show significantly increased  systemic cytokine release (i.e. cytokine storm), particularly those patients with lung fa ilure or systemic organ failure ( Chao/ in Huang et al. Lancet vol 395 2020, ref
1).

Previous studies at Virologik GmbH,Erlangen,Germany,in colaboration with the Friedrich-Loeffler­ lnstitut,Tuebingen,Germany have shown, that HSN! (or alternatively LPS) -induced Cytokine storm in vivo can be inhibited by application of Proteasome Inhibitors (E. Haasbach et al,An tiviral Res. 91, 2011, ref.2), via the inhibition of translocation of the NF-1CB transcription factor to the nucleus (see Fig. below).The mechanism of NF-KB inhibition by proteasome inhibitors is well described, and works via the inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor IKB, this way keeping NF-KB bound in the cytosol and thereby inhibiting the otherwise induced (by cytokine or LPS- or RNA virus) translocation of NF-KB to the nucleus where it would initiate the transcription of many cytokines. This effect of proteasome inhibitors seems to work in most cell types, we could demonstrate this effect in several different cell types (including macrophages) after stimulation with TNFa in vitro and in HSNl (or LPS) treated mice in vivo (see manuscript and Figs. attached).

Inhibition of NF·lCB by proteasome inhibitors provides the unique potential to inhibit the release of
many cytokines simultaneously, in particular strongly proinflammatory cytokines IL-lCl,IL-6, TNFa, MIP-
113...) (whereas some other cytokines involved in antiviral immune response, s.uch as IFNy probably seem
to be not/less affected (because of different transcription pathway).

Importantly, beside the anti-inflammatory activity, proteasome inhibitors showed also significant anti­ fibrotic activity (Lueftenegger et al., manuscript and figs attached),which may be also important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with heavy lung disease.

Furthermore, there have been several publications showing that in particular early phases of the replication cycle of Corona virus seem to be dependent on interaction with the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) of the host cell,and were effectively inhibited by selective 205 proteasome inhibitors (such as Velcade)  (Wang et al. VirologyJ 2010, 7:99 (ref. 3}; M. Raaben et al. J. Virology, 84(15), 2010, ref. 4).
There are several registered proteasome inhibitors (Bortezomib (Velcade®) e.g. produced by Millennium Pharmaceuticals (i.e Takeda Oncology); Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®), h<azomib (Ninlaro®)) for treatment of multiple myeloma and Mantel cell lymphoma, i.e. there are registered drugs with well known side effects available to be tested in small clinical studies for evaluation of their therapeutic
efficacy in COVID-19 patients with heavy lung disease and other organ failure. Noteworthy: in contrast
to the chronical oncological indications where up to 8 treatment cycles (and sometimes even more) are applied, it seems plausible that just one or two treatment cycles of proteasome inhibitors might be sufficient to downregulate the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, which would be associated also with  much lower side effects.

Early first experience on efficacy could be ga ined from compassionate use applications in heavily ill COVID-19 patients very quickly. Beside the registered application forms, i.e. infusions, probably also inhalative application should be tested as well, because it may be better suited to reach the respective target cells in the lung, Le. alveolar epithelial cell and alveolar macrophages. There are multiple inhalative devices available, e.g. the Handyhaler by Boehringer lngelheim used for Spiriva (for COPD treatment).

Although there are still many open questions,the potential to control the cytokine storm-induced heavy lung and other organ failure by using already registered drugs,ie. proteasome inhibitors may be a real chance to get an additional treatment option, hopefully decreasing the cases necessary for artificial aeration.

Please forward this mail to the colleages you consider relevant for evaluation, discussion and consideration for your clinical strategy for COVID-19.

Please let me know if additional informations are necessary.

To my person: I have MD PhD degree and have many years experience in pharmaceutical development (Boehringer lngelheim), Biotech (lgeneon, Aphton, Virologik GmbH) (for reference see also PubMed Kircheis r) currently leading R&D activities at Syntacoll (part of lnnocoll).

Abstract

The appearance of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses of the HSN1 subtype being able to infect humans and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic reveals the urgent need for new and efficient countermeasures against these viruses. The long-term efficacy of current antivirals is often limited, because of the emergence of drug-resistant virus mutants. A growing understanding of the virus-host interaction raises the possibility to explore alternative targets involved in the viral replication. In the present study we show that the proteasome inhibitor VL-01 leads to reduction of influenza virus replication in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells {A549) as demonstrated with three
different influenza virus strains, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (ECSO value of 1.7 µM),

A/Regensburg/06/09 (H1N1v) (EC50 value of 2.4 µM) and A/Mallard/Bavaria/1/2006 (H5N1) (EC50 value of 0.8 µM). In in vivo experiments we could demonstrate that VL-01-aerosol-treatment of BALB/c mice with 14.1 mg/kg results in no toxic side effects, reduced progeny virus titers in the lung
(1.1 ± 0.3 log10 pfu) and enhanced survival of mice after infection with a 5-fold MLD50 of the human influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) up to 50%. Furthermore, treatment of mice with

VL-01 reduced the cytokine release of IL-a/13, IL-6, MIP-113. RANTES and TNF-a induced by LPS or highly pathogen avian H5N1 influenza A virus. The present data demonstrates an antiviral effect of VL-01 in vitro and in vivo and the ability to reduce influenza virus induced cytokines and chemokines.

Dear Tony,


I have always felt reassured when the good Dr. Fauci speaks, and now more than ever. As an American , a former colleague,a long-time admirer and student of your wisdom -thank you . We are all safer because of you, and the world will be a better place because of you. Again.

As you know,I am now leading the ONE Campaign.  We've been quite active with the ONEWorld Campaign, dedicated to the fight against this newest virus, and focused on Africa. We've made some progress on debt,and next up is a focus on ensuring that a vaccine, when it comes,is available to everyone.

One of the things we want to do is educate people, in all of the places we work.  It won't surprise you that of particular urgency amongst our partners in Africa is that facts and information get to people across the continent, but we also know that more facts are needed everywhere. So next month we are going to launch #PassTheMic , where every day for 19 days we will ask a celebrity to turn his or her soc ial media channels over to an expert on COVID-19 for one day. So Julia Roberts might turn her Twitter account to you to talk about the critical elements needed to flatten the curve and slow the spread .Or Idris Elba could give up his lnstagram to the head of the African CDC so that he can illustrate the impact COVID-19 will have across Africa and what that means for the rest of the world .

We know artists want to be helpful right now, but that it is hard to know what to do. And we know there are experts like you out there who have the answers. We've thought about this a lot at ONE and wanted to do something we felt would truly have an impact. As we look ahead we know COVID-19 does not know borders and until it is beaten everywhere we are not in the clear. We need a global response plan and we need it now. By turning over their platforms for the day,celebrity influencers will be donating one of their biggest
assets - their followers - to YO U,giving you the platform you need (and we all need) to tell
the world why a global response is critical. Because none of us are safe until all of us are safe.


We will work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our celebrity partners' a udiences - in North Amer ica,Europe and Africa , and help create content that both parties are happy with. We are now confirming our talent partners, and so far are getting a terrific response.

We know you're a busy man, so we've planned it so that the amount of time on your end
would be minimal. But the impact would be maximal.


I'm attaching more information about the campaign. Please let me know what you think and if you have questions. Ideally we would like to get this off the ground in early May, so are hoping to confirm folks by Apr il 28th at the latest. Our team will be in touch with your office to follow up.

Thanks as always for everything you do. All my best to you, Gayle

Dear Tony:

It's been a long time. Honestly , I can't remember when we last saw each other. I recall that wonderful day we went to the Nats game together , although I cannot remember who else came with us. And of course Iwill always remember when you came to my Partners in Health fundraiser and i ntroduced Paul Farmer. I will never forg	our speech (and neither will Paul! .
Ooce	oo
I apologize for dropping out of touch.

Those events were so many years ago,	(b) (6) no?  So much has happened and changed since then,and now, seeing you and listening to your wise words and advice every day,I am reminded that we need to reconnect, when it's safe and you have time.  We have so much to catch up on!	I have been meaning to write to you or call you,but I had misplaced your email address and phone numbers. I hope this address works and this message reaches you.

Meantime, thank you for your service to our country .indeed the world. You have been a solid, wise, steady voice, Tony , and, despite all the naysayers and fools on social media, you have earned the respect of billions of people. I am very proud of you, and am humbled and honored that Ican call you my friend .

I hope you and your family are well, and staying safe. The Broas family is doing well, thanks in no small part to your daily advice and objective analysis . Thank you!   Please let me know if there is anything Ican do for you or your family.

Looking forward to seeing you on the other side of this,and having a good catch up. Who knows, maybe at a Nats game?

Hello Tony,

Congratulations on being a Career Achievement finalist for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals (Sammies). I'm writing a Federal Insider column about the finalists and would like arrange a telephone interview with your for the story.

My questions include:
Why did you join the federal service?
Is there one example or anecdote that makes you particularly proud of you work? What do you like most about your job?
What do you like least about your job ?
Why would you recommend, or not, your agency and/or the federal government to those seeking career advice?

I know this is an incredibly busy time for you. I appreciate that the life and death issues related to the coronavirus are more important than any award. Non etheless, I hope you

can spare 10or15minutes for a telephone interview on Tuesday or Wednesday, April 28 or 29. I can also make other days that week work

Thank you.

Best,
Joe

Dinah and Ned,

lt was a pleasure talking to you about what you are considering. As we discussed, here is the NIAID Strategic Plan that was just published, and two models of funding opportunity announcements for you to consider as models. l also think the Cancer Centers have aspects of collaboration , shared facilities, and research focus that you can borrow. So much of what NIAID has built is modeled on the Cancer Centers.

H i Jennife r et al: Here are a few questions for Dr . Fauci .

Scientists from the University of Bristol found that the coronavirus has unexpected tendency to large mutations in the spike protein when its grown in monkey cells . This had been seen

before as a virus that was unwilling to mutate . Does this create any concerns about vacc ine design and effectiveness?

It now appears that some people who recover from Covid have no antibodies to the SARS-Cov2 . Wha t are the poss ible explanations for this? Has it occurred in other viral diseases? Does it have any implications for the effectiveness of vaccines? Is NIAID invest igating this? Is there a possibility that the virus sequesters in cells?

Another feature of coronaviruses appears to be rapidly waning immunity . Has this been seen in any NIAID experiments ? What does this suggest about the virus 's ability to evade the immune system?

A laboratory at Oxford has suggested that, if all goes well , they may be finished with phase 3 trials in 5000 people by the fall, which could mean as early as September . Does that sound realistic to you?

Some companies are asking regulators to make sure that safety standards are upheld for ma kers of Covid vaccines , and that corners aren 't cut . Is it worth cutting some safety corners to get a Covid vacc ine ready for distribution?


How many peop le should the Moderna vaccine be tested in in phase
3? How long would you expect those trials to take?

Thanks very much, hope we can set this up soon . All best , JL +44

Dear Ms. Patricia Conrad

Dear Ms. Kimberly Marie Barasch

I hope you are well despite the current devastating world pandemic.

The Bolivian Society of Intensive Care together with the Bolivian Healthcare Ministry are writing the national guidelines for the management of COVID-19 in the critically ill patient, an issue that is an emergency worldwide and may
become disastrous in the low-middle income countries of Latin America if not
managed since the beginning with precise , accurate and uniform approaches.

With our team in Erasme University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium, together with Professors Jean - Louis Vincent, Fabio Taccone, Jean Charles Preiser, Jacques Creteur, etc., we are preparing the material with other Bolivian and Mexican intensivists , internists, infectologists ,imagenologists.

Iwonder if Dr. Anthony Fauci would honor us coauthoring and reviewing our last
version of some chapters of our guidelines. Best regards,
AAQC

Subject:spreading determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Dear Tony,
we are all witnessing the great effort your collaborators and yourse lf are investing over this pandemic emergency .

As you well know, in Europe and Italy we had the unfortunate privilege of having been first hit hard by
the pandemic, after China .


We had the opportunity of meta-analyzing data from 170.000 patients in European countries,for associated determina nts of the spread ing force of COVID-19.

If this may provide a useful, albeit non gratifying, contr ibution for the US and other countries, we would
feel we had done our job .

Dear Dr A. Faucy,

we don't know each other. I was born	Cb) C6J 1am a simple doctor  in Medicin and live in a remote Italian region. I am no one. I trust in God that you can read my paper, being publish ed. I send it to you to anticipate the exit times because I trust that we can really understand what Covid 19 is. Being nobody, I did what nobody would have done. I u sed the few tools I had available and questioned all the papers and data published so far. I describe what the dual mechanism of the Covid-19 can be.  anticipate that the result conclusioni  is not to my credit but I have been helped. I wish you a good read. May God bless us.




Sincerely with love,

Dr. Carlo Brogna M.D.

Subject: impact of baricitinib in COVID-19-an off label study CONFIDENTIAL


dear dr Fauci, good morning. I hope you are fine.


Apologies to disturb you but it may be of your interest. Isaw in the web that you {NIAID/Fauci)( https:ljinvestor .lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lil  ly-begins-clinical-testing-therapies-cov id-19) will be support a trial using Baricitinib as part of the ACTT trial...

Icollaborated with Fabrizio Ca ntini (he reads in cc), a reumathologist of Prato to write a letter to J Infection (pdf attached). He conducted an off- label study in patients with mild-moderate pneumonia with COVID-19 [(Sp02) >92% at room-a ir, and ratio arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (Pa02/Fi02) 100-300 mmHg] to evaluate the impact ofbaritinib (tablet 4 mg/day) in terms of safety, clinical respiratory improvements, discharge,ICU transfer in 2 weeks; these patients received also lopinavi r/ritonavir therapy. The last consecutive patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard of care therapy
{lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine) admitted before the date of the first baricitinib-treated patient
served as controls.


The results of this off-label study, with the limit of not been a RCT, are encouraging:
1. Safety: only 1/12 case of transaminase elevation at day 10, likely due to lopinavir ritonavir co­ administration because baricitinib is mainly renal secreted
2. Respiratory improvement : Sp02 and ratio arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen
(Pa02/Fi02) significant ly improved;
3. Discharge in 7/12 vs 1/12
4.  ICU transfer (0/12 vs 4/12)


Ido hope it may be a useful, although Iam aware that it is a very preliminary info for you. Thank you for your attention.
All the best
Delia

dear dr Fauci, apologies to write you in these busy days. It is only to express all my gratitude for what you have done in your life to fight infectious diseases  and what you  are doing now for COVID-19. Your efforts and achievement are in front of the whole world and for me it is a great honor to have been with you in 1992-1996 at the time of HIV fight. As I told you many times , you are a model of excellence!

Only to keep you updated in my life, I am fine, and I mainly work as an ID specialist and scientist at the same place in Rome, the National Institute for Infectious Diseases L. Spallanzani. I am doing 2 days a week outpatients TB clinic and I run a small laboratory on TB research . However, given the pandemia, I shifted the lab activities on COVID-19, in particular on:
1. the role of coinfection (COVID-19 coinfection with tuberculosis , or COVID-19 coinfection with HIV) on the modulation of the in vitro immune specific-response to SARS-CoV-2, or M. tuberculosis or HIV in cells from COVID-19 patients at different clinical stage

2. in vitro evaluation of the immunological and virological effect of baricinib, an anti-JAK1 and -JAK2 drugs , used in reumathoid arthritis, that has shown using BenevolentAl's proprietary artificial intelligence-derived knowledge graph , as an agent that reduces the SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis into target cells potentially inhibiting the entry.

Moreover, Iwould be happy to contribute in any activity you may think I am useful.

Iwish you a happy Easter in this blessed day.

Thank you for your attention and for having had the possibility of working with you that has been crucial in my personal and professional life.

All the best
Delia

A panel of U.S. physicians, statisticians, and other experts has developed treatment guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These guidelines, intended for healthcare providers, are based on published and prelimina1y data and the clinical expertise of the panelists, many of whom are frontline clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving pandemic. The guidelines are posted online (covidl9treatmentguidelines.nih.gov) and will be updated often as new data are published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and other authoritative information emerges.

The guidelines consider two broad categories of therapies currently in use by healthcare providers for COVID-19: antivirals, which may target the coronavirus directly, and host
modifiers and immune-based therapies, which may influence the immune response to the virus or target the virus.

The panel's conclusions about treating COVJD-19 with various agents that fall into these two classes of therapies are distilled in summary recommendations. Subsequently, the document provides background information about each agent-such as clinical data about its use, ongoing clinical trials, and known interactions with other drugs-that fom1s the basis for the Recommendation. Tables briefly outline the same information.

The guidelines also describe the evaluation and stratification of patients based on their risk of infection and severity of illness. Recommendations in this section address best practices for managing patients at different stages of infection, for example:

 Outpatients who are either asymptomatic or who have mild to moderate symptoms and are self­ isolating
 Inpatients with severe illness or critical disease
Special considerations for pregnant women and for children who are infected are also included. A comprehensive section of the guidelines addresses a range of considerations for clinicians
caring for the most critically ill hospitali zed patients. This section includes multiple

recommendations for patients needing critical care, including infection control procedures,

hemodynamic and ventilatory support, and drug therapy.


Finally, the guidelines include recommendations concerning the use of concomitant medications. These include statins; corticosteroids; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and certain drugs used to contrnl hypertension, known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs.

The treatment guidelines panel is co-chaired by Roy M. Gulick, M.D., chief of the Infectious Disease Division at Weill Medical Hospital of Cornell University, New York City; H. Clifford Lane,  M.D.,  clinical  director  of  the  National   lnstltute  of  Allergy  and  lnfectious  Diseases, National Institutes of Health; and Henry Masur, M.D., chief of the Critical Care Medicine Department  at the NIH Clinical  Center.  Members of  the guidelines panel, appointed by the co­ chairs, were chosen based on their clinical experience and expertise inpatient management, translationa l  and clinical  science, and/or  the development of  treatment  guidelines.  They  include 30 experts drawn from U .S. healthcare and academic organizations, federal agencies, and professional societies.

Abstract
Background Addressing COVID-19 is a pressing health and social concern. To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa
Clara County. Methods On 4/3-4/4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a representative sample of the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of 3,330 people, adjusting for zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity . We also adjust for test performance characteristics using 3 different estimates: (i) the test manufacturer's data, (ii) a sample of 37 positive and 30 negative controls tested at Stanford, and (iii) a combination of both. Results The unadjusted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County was 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI 1.11-1.97%), and the population-weighted prevalence was 2.81% (95CI 2.24-3.37%). Under the three scenarios for test performance characteristics, the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara ranged from 2.49% (95CI 1.80-3.17%) to 4.16% (2.58-5.70%).
These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 50-85-fold more than the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions The
population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. Population prevalence estimates can now be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.

Thank you for your note. Shown below are my answers to your questions .
hope that you find them helpful.


1. How do you recommend I reassure our staff on dealing with the stressors of COVID-19?
This is indeed an unprecedented and stressful time. Stress can often come from the unknown. In times of stress it is critical to take care of one's physical health, by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising. In addition,maintaining connections with family and friends (via phone calls, email, or video chatting) while physically socially distancing is very important .

2 .  Can COVID-19 be contracted from a corpse?
Infection control measures should be undertaken when dealing with deceased individuals with known or suspected COVID-19. The CDC provides guidance on this issue here:Caution­ https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidancc-postmortem-
specimens.htm1 < Caution-https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance­
postmortem-specimens.html >


3.  If someone has been a user of Hydroxychloroquine for years, are they susceptible to contracting COVI0-19?
Clinical trials are underway to determine if hydroxychloroquine is effective in preventing COVlD- 19 in exposed persons. Until we know the answer to this question,persons who take hydroxychloroquine on a daily basis for another medical condition should consider themselves
vulnerable to COVID-19 and take appropriate and recommended measures to protect
themselves.


4.  Are masks and gloves truly effective, if so, why are so many medical professionals contracting the virus?
Ibelieve that infection control strategies which include proper use of personal protective
equipment (PPE) as recommended by the CDC are effective._
Caution-https://www.cdc.govIcoronavims/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-contro1-
recommendations   .htrnl?CDC_AA_  refVal=https%3A%2F%2FCaution-

recommendat ions.html >
In cases where inadequate PPE is worn, or if is not put on/taken off according to proper procedure, the risk of contracting COVID is increased.  In addition, healthcare workers on the front lines can be exposed if they encounter a patient who is not initially suspected of having COVID-19 without PPE, especially if they are exposed to aerosol generating processes.


s. What is the most important thingwe should be doing,other than socia ldistancing?
Social distancing is key in order to avoid coming into contact with someone with COVID-19, but washing one's hands often (or using an alchohol-based hand sanitizer) and avoiding touching one's face with unwashed hands are critical as well,especially when coming into contact with surfaces that may have been touched by others or public places.

6.  Finally, what keeps you up at night, regarding COVID-19?
Ihave said in the past that what keeps me up at night is the possibility of a pandemic respiratory infection.  We are in that reality now, and what keeps me up at night is lhe response, a major part of which ls the development of an effective vaccine and treatments for COVID-19.

C/O Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. Hello Dr. Fauci,

In the current state of medical know ledge and research in the pharmaceutical industry,there is no short- or medium-term solution to prevent disease or cure patients with SARS-Cov-2 (COVID- 19).

With this letter, I would like to make you aware of the preventive and curative potential of essential oils (EOs); lives could be saved.

Scientific aromatherapy: use of aromatic compounds extracted from plants - essential oils - for medical purposes; 'hard' science of nature, based among other things, on in-depth knowledge of organic chemistry. We are not talking about perfumery or occult sciences .

According to Mr. Dominique BAUDOUX, an internationally known Belgian pharmacist and "aromatologist": there is a multitude of research on the antiviral properties  of essential oils. The results are impressive and indisputable . Here are some viruses for  which we have real data:

 Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-Cov (it is a coronavirus)
 The H1Nl flu virus
 Avian influenza virus type H5Nl and subtypes H7N3 and H9N2
 The anti-infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)
 Herpes simplex virus HSV
 Dengue virus DEN
 Newcastle disease virus NDV
 Junin virus (an arena virus responsible for hemorrhagic fever)

To add meat to the bone, if you visit the National Center for Biotechnology Information (U.S.) :
 You will find nearly 225 000 references on "essential oil."
See  : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=essential%20oil
 You will find approximately 22 000 references on "essential oil+ viral."
See : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=essential%20oil%20+%20viral


In addition,according to a brief email exchange with Mr. Pierre FRANCHOMME, a French researcher, one of the leading experts in the field of medicinal essential oils, he informed me that :a recent Indian study (March 31) highlights the potential activity of 1,8 cineole (eucalyptol) on SARS-Cov-2, as I suspected from my experience on other enveloped viruses.

Note: the molecule 1,8 cineole is found in high concentration in eucalyptus EOs.

Source : https://www.preprints.org/ma nuscri pt/202003.0455/vl

Another study (2008) provided by Mr. Franchomme, shows a high antiviralactivity of bay laurel/leaf essential oil (Laurus nobilis) on SARS-Cov, which appeared in November 2002 in Guangdong province, China and w hich prevailed until 2004.
 Loizzo, M. R., Saab, A. M., Tundis, R., Statti,G.A., Menichini,F., Lampronti,I., ... Doerr,
H.W. (2008). Phytochemical Analysis and in vitro Antiviral Activities of the Essential Oils of Seven Lebanon Species.Chemistry & Biodiversity, 5(3), 461-470. doi
:10.1002/cbdv.200890045
Source:   https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbdv.200890045


Since SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 {COVID-19) are close relatives, it is quite possible that Laurus nobifis essential oilwill be as effective on SARS-Cov-2.

Here are two other studies that should be of interest to researchers, accordingto Mr. FRANCHO MME:
 See reference 20 below Efficacy of cineole in patients suffering from acute bronchitis:a placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Cough 9, 25 (2013).
Source:   https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-9974-9-25


Conclusions of this study : The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be p roven aft er a treatment p eriod of merely 4 days. This study corroborates the fact that cineo/e actively and significantly reduces coug h frequenc y afterf our days. Therefore it has been shown to have a grea t socioeconomic impact.

 See also reference 22 beloN.

Also, according to Mr. FRANCHOMME, a clinical study on the treatment of essential oils in patients with COVID-19 has just been undertaken in a hospital setting (100 patients), double blind against placebo. I will know the results at the same time as everyone else and will inform you.


Here is a summary of Mr. FRANCHOMME's analysis:











The scientific community is launcliecl in searcnof a miraclearug in tnebciSket of mo ecu es already known for other indications. Our design is to trust the plant world, a great provider of remarkable molecules .

CONCLUSION


We need to think outside the box of allopathic medicine and synthetic drugs that offer no solution and put pressure on our leaders to release funds for clinical research on the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19 using essential oils, as advocated by Mr. Franchomme.



(b) 4}


To this end, M. FRANCHOMME confirmed to me this: I am at the disposal of your authorities to provide and explain a protocol based on essential oils.
His email address is :	(b) C6l

Interms of a double-blind placebo clinical study, there is, as of today, a huge cohort of hospitalized patients, a significant portion of whom I suspect would be enthusiast ic about voluntary  enrolment.

For patients in critical care with a life-threatening prognosis, it is undoubtedly possible, given the circumstances,to bypass the usual research protocols and offer a last-resort treatment to these patients in an attempt to save their lives, with their permission or that of their legal representatives in case of temporary or permanent incapacity.

Even if it doesn't work, Idon't think patients or their loved ones will blame your government for trying everything,but if you don't, Iwouldn't like to be in your shoes !
Cordially, Benoit Ponton

Nearly a third of 200 blood samples taken in Chelsea show exposure to coronavirus
Mass. General researcher says the results point to a 'raging

epidemic,'  but may also indicate the city is further along the disease curve than some other municipalities

                                           First responders loaded a patient into an ambulance from a nursing home where multiple people have contracted COID-19 in Chelsea, which has the highest concentration of COVID-19 infections in the state.Scott Eisen/Getty
Nearly one third of 200 Chelsea residents who gave a drop of blood to researchers on the street this week tested positive for antibodies linked to COVID-19, a startling indication of how widespread infections have been in the densely populated city.
Sixty-four residents who had a finger pricked in Bellingham Square on Tuesday and Wednesday had
antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the coronavirus, according to Massachusetts General Hospital physicians who ran the pilot study.
The 200 participants generally appeared healthy, but about half told the doctors they had had at least one symptom of COVID-19 in the past four weeks.
Public health experts already knew Chelsea hadthe state's highes t rate of con firmed COVID-19 cases and that the actual rate was probably higher. At least 39 residents have died from the virus, and 712 had tested positive as of Tuesday, a rate of about 1,900 cases per 100,000 residents, or almost 2 percent.
Get Talking Points in your inboxAn afternoon recap of the day's most important business news,
delivered Monday through Friday.
But the Mass. General researchers - who excluded anyone who had tested positive for the virus in the standard nasal swab test - found that 32 percent of participants have had COVID-19, and many didn't know it.
"I think it's both good news and bad news," said Dr. John Iafrate, vice chairman of MGH's pathology
department and the study's principal investigator. "The bad news is that there's a raging epidemic in Chelsea, and many people walking on the street don't know that they're carrying the virus and that they may be exposing uninfected individuals in their families."
"On the good-news side, it suggests that Chelsea has made its way through a good part of the epidemic," he said . "They' re probably further along than other towns."
Scientists suspect that people who recover from COVID-19 may be at least temporarily immune from
catching it again. Several biotechs and academic laboratories, in fact, are seeking blood donations from people who have recovered, in the hopes that their antibodies can help create a treatment or vaccine.

Chelsea's city manager, Thomas Ambrosino, said he learned the results of the pilot study Thursday in a conference call with the researchers. He was dismayed, but not shocked.
Related: Chel sea city manager sounds urgent alarm . calls fo r residents to stay home 24 hours a day "We've long thought that the reported numbers are vastly under-counting what the actual infection is," said Ambrosino, who has called his city the epicenter of the crisis in Massachusetts. "Those reported numbers are based on positive COVID-19 tests, and we're all aware that a very, very small percentage of people in Chelsea and everywhere are getting COVID-19 tests."

"Still," he added, "it's kind of sobering that 30 percent of a random group of 200 people that are showing no symptoms are, in fact, infected. It's all the more reason for everyone to be practicing physical distancing."
Indeed, one of the doctors who tested volunteers in Bellingham Square said it's possible that some of the people who had the antibodies are still contagious.
"Just because you have the antibodies doesn't mean you've cleared the virus," said Dr. Vivek Naranbhai,
a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology.
Researchers said the test results, which had yet to be shared with state officials late Friday, couldn't necessarily be extrapolated for the city's roughly 40,000 residents. Still, the findings provided a valuable snapshot of a community that medical experts say is especially vulnerable to COVID-19.
Chelsea covers only about two square miles, across the Mystic River from Boston. For generations, it has attracted new immigrants, and about 65 percent of its residents are Latino. Many live in three-decker houses, Ambrosino said, where it's hard for people to isolate themselves. Many work in the hospitality industry and health-related fields, where exposure to the virus is greater. And a lot of them must go to work during the pandemic.

To get Chelsea residents to participate in the study - which included a questionnaire that was available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese - investigators allowed them to remain anonymous. But that meant none of the participants received the results of the blood tests.
The doctors used a diagnostic device made by BioMedomics, of Morrisville, N.C., to analyze drops of blood. It resembled an over-the-counter pregnancy test and generated results on the street in about 10 minutes. Although the test hasn't won the approval of the Food and Drug Administrat ion, Iafrate, the principal investigator, sa id Mass. General determined it's reliable.
Within days, the physicians said, they hope to set up a medical tent outside the Mass. General Chelsea Healthcare Center to perform more antibodies tests w ith the device. The site w ill be located near a tent set up weeks ago to run standard PCR, or polymerase chain react ion, tests for people with active coronavirus symptoms . The latter uses nasal swabs to detect whether the virus is present at the time; the ant ibodies blood test reveals whether someone was infected in the past.



In addition to the new testing site, the researchers want to expand the study to other Massachusetts cities and towns . For all of those studies, Mass. General doctors plan to obtain the identities of participants so physicians can provide the results. But f irst the researchers need to come up with guidelines for what participants should do if they test positive for antibodies .
Dr. Dean Xerras, medical director of the Mass. General Chelsea Healthcare Center and a co-investigator
in the study, sa id it illustrates why it's essential for Chelsea and other communities to perform more tests, regardless of whether they detect antibodies or the virus itself.
"Knowing how many people are infected is critical," said Xerras, a longtime member of the city's board
of health. "We need to get them isolated. We need to get masks delivered to the city. We need to launch more safe isolation sites. We need to be able to identify cases and then give people the things they need to prevent perpetuation of the spread."
Chelsea and Revere officials, with help from the state Department of Public Health and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, secured almost 150 rooms at a Quality Inn in Revere this week for residents who are recovering from COVID-19 and unable to isolate themselves at home, according to Ambrosino. So far, only a handful of those rooms are occupied.
Governor Charlie Baker on Thursday staunchly defended the state's handling of the escalating
outbreak in Chelsea, including asserting, without offering details, that city leaders have turned down help from his administration.

The governor's claim surprised officials in Chelsea who told the Globe this week that the state, and even health care providers, should have recognized the virus's rapid spread through the city sooner.

The estimates on this page have been updated from an earlier report published in December 2018 based on more recently available information. There is a trade-off between timeliness and accuracy of the burden estimates. To provide timely burden estimates to the public, clinicians, and public health decision-makers, we use preliminary data that may lead to over- or under-estimates of the true burden.  However, each season's estimates will be finalized when data on testing practices and deaths for that season are available.
For the revised 2017-2018 estimates, we included additional information in our estimation
regarding influenza testing practices. The surveillance system used to estimate influenza­
related hospitalizations, FluSurv-NET, collects data on patients hospitalized with
laboratory-confirmed influenza .Influenza testing is done at the request of the clinician, but not everyone is tested and influenza tests are not perfectly accurate. Thus, the reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations to FluSurv-NET are likely underestimates of the true number of hospitalizations. To adjust for this, CDC collects data annually from participating FluSurv-NET sites on the amount of influenza testing and the type of test that is used at the site, and this information is used to correct for the possible underestimate of influenza-related hospitalizations . These testing data are often not available for up to two years after the end of an influenza season, and thus the estimates are revised when additional testing data become available . For the original preliminary 2017-2018 burden estimates, data on testing practices during the 2014-2015 season were used to make preliminary estimates because this season had the highest levels of testing among the prior seasons for which data were available and resulted in the most
conservative (lowest) estimates of burden. More recent data from the 2016-17 season
show that influenza testing has been increasing among most age groups. The current estimates were made using the highest testing rate for each age-group during 2010-11to 2016-17 and has resulted in some burden estimates being lower than previously estimated.
Additionally, the method we use to estimate influenza-associated deaths relies on additional data from FluSurv-NEf and the National Center for Health Statistics (data on cause of deaths and numbers of deaths that occur in versus outside the hospital) that are also not available for up to two years after the end of the season being estimated .
The 2017-2018 estimates are still preliminary because not all of the required data are
currently available.  When those data become available, these estimates will be updated again and the results may change.
More answers to frequently asked questions about CDC's influenza burden estimates are
available.

Tony,


Wishing you well. Wanted you to be aware that we're releasing a report at a media briefing this morning on how to "Box In COVID." This plan includes prioritized expansion of testing and building a corps of contact tracers in the US, using tried-and-true public health measures at scale.There are four essential actions to box in the virus: 1) Expand testing; 2) Isolate infected people to prevent spread; 3) Identify contacts who may have exposed; 4) Quarantine contacts . As you know, all four are crucial; if any one is lacking, the virus can escape and spread explosively again. Success requires a massive expansion of our public health capacity around the country and world.

The report is attached and can be downloaded here. Please let me know how we can
continue to be as supportive as possible.


A ll the best, Tom

Washington, DC 20502

Dear Sir,

Many of us in the hyperbaric medicine community believe that there exists a simple
therapy to halt the inflammatory process and reverse the lung damage.

This process will also simultaneously provide many times over the amount of oxygenation offered by the coma-inducing intubation
ventilator procedure.

We are reaching out to our network to make contact with the airlines to secure the use of an airplane with an onboard APU (Auxiliary Power Unit--used to pressurize the aircraft) for a month, to treat COVID-19 patients and show the effectiveness of the concept.

Initial testing indicates in one trial study 100% improvement while all others underway,
although small scale, are showing great benefit at extremely low cost and patient risk.

So what is this new procedure? Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy or HBOT; first used successfully in 1918 for Spanish Flu cases. HBOT is viable and appears to work well but we do not have the number of pressure vessels / HB chambers available to treat the possibly
100,000+ who need the therapy now.

Several of us in our small community have arrived at the same idea in several
countries.

The idea is no longer new or unique.

Again, I am proposing use an aircraft as the pressure vessel. Every airplane with a pressurized cabin (i.e., all commercial airline aircraft) is routinely pressurized to around 9 psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground, as part of their normal airworthiness testing.

Myself and others have suggested that one or more of the hundreds of grounded aircraft
be provided to complete the trial test.

737 Max are not flying but are a perfect pressure vessel for the procedure.

Could you help us contact Boeing, the airlines or the military?

No aircraft modification is required whatsoever so that is one of the issues off the table.


The aircraft remains parked on the ground with access for ambulatory patients via a stairway. No jetway is required unless we expand this in the future for non-ambulatory patients.

We would need to place standard DOT portable oxygen tanks in the cabin along with the associated manifold, pressure regulator, flow-meters and tubing.

Each patient will have his/her own anesthesia mask and breathing circuit.

There is no cross contamination between patients or the cabin environment atmosphere as each mask incorporates a Viral Filter Kit to help protect the technicians who are also breathing  from  a secure,  clean  source.

AlJ safety issues are addressed in the plan.

The same process, once proven could be utilized by our military and of course our Navy who is experiencing possible outbreaks as we speak.

This is im  ortant to me personally





The Patriot Clinic in Oklahoma City is my personal charity where we have provided over
i5,ooo free HBOT treatments for our beloved vets and 30,000+ at cost or below.

We are not asking for money. Nor, amIselling anything in this effort. With the help of a
small group of supporters, (Ralph Crafts & family ) my company is willing to provide the equipment, training and technical support to begin the process.

Thank you for your ongoing service to our country, and thank you for reading and
considering my proposal.

Isure would appreciate your help. Semper Fi!
Sincerely,
Edward A. Betts

Matt Pottinger
Deputy National Security Advisor
The White House
1650 Pennsylvania Ave., NW
Washington, DC 20502 Sir:
As one old Marine to another Marine, this letter contains the "straight scoop," and is intended to provide infonnation that can help stop the spread of COVID-19, and ensure the continuity of critical segments of government.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has been inuse for over 100years, and was the only effective treatment for the 1918 flu pandemic. HBOT is being used worldwide to treat a variety of serious diseases, and h as been proven to be immediately effective in treating severe COVID- 19 cases, with a success rate close to 100%.

HBOT is simply breathing high-purity oxygen (92% or higher) for 60-90 minutes in a pressurized environment (typically between 8 and 15psi-the higher pressure is about the same pressure as doing a SCUBA dive to 33 feet). HBOT chambers can be 1-2 person sizes and
portable, up to 12-seat chambers which are used for Navy operations.	(b)(      I have a one-
person chamber in our home, and we can attest to its effectiveness in treating severe breathing problems, like pneumonia, infections, and wounds.

The currently publicized and widely accepted  statement that there  is no  effective treatment  for COVID-19  is wrong.   HBOT treatments,  u sually ju st a single one-hour  session, provide immediate improvements in lung function, blood-oxygen  levels, and organ recovery.  Unlike respirators, which do more damage than good and are basically a death sentence, HBOT provides an immediate path for recovery and healing.

A team of ve1y experienced scientists and HBOT experts have developed a concept that will enable the effective treatment of large numbers of people by using some of the thousands of grounded commercial aircraft as large HBOT chambers.



I'm an old Marine Corps jet pilot, and we u se our	(b) (6)
so I have the professional contacts to confirm and verify the efficacy
of the concept.

Every airplane with a pressurized cabin (i.e., all airline aircraft) is routinely pressurized to around 9psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground, as part of their normal airworthiness testing.

We have equipment staged and ready to go now, to treat 25 COVID- 19 patients at a time-we need an airplane, and we can be treating people and saving lives in about 36 hours.



The aircraft we need remain parked on the ground, no modifications  are needed-we will simply place portable oxygen tanks in the cabin with the associated tubing, manifold, and pressure regulators, and each patient will have his/her own anesthesia mask .


There is no cross contamination between patients , becaus e everyone is breathing oxygen from their own persona l mask.



We are reaching out to our contacts in the airlines to ask for the use of an airplane and APU (Auxiliary Power Unit-used to pressurize the aircraft) for a month, to treat COVID-19 patients and show the e.ffectiveness of the concept.



We could do the same thing with a single military transpo1i aircraft (many of which have been
configured for medical use).



As a Marine, and with my knowledge of HBOT, the recent death of the Theodore Roosevelt sailor is particu larly upsetting, knowing that a couple of Senior Chiefs or Marine Master Sergeants could have configured an aircraft irt Guam in a couple of hours and be treating all the sailors from the carrier.


We are not asking for money-my wife andIare paying for all 1he required  equipment and
support personnel.

HBOT chambers are easily implemented and supported-you could have one in your office (ours is 8' long and 34" in diameter when pressurized) and it would only take a couple of hours to train your corpsmen to operate it. I don't know of a better guarantee of continuity in the current pandemic.

Please note that	CbH6J I have no financial or political interests in the HBOT treatment concept, companies, or manufacturers-we receive no benefits/rewards, other than helping to save many lives.



You will receive a letter from Ed Betts-he's a good man, really knows his stuff, and I trust him
with my life-please take what he says seriously.


Thank you for your ongoing service to our country, and thank you for reading and considering the informat ion in this letter.

Semper Fi !

Respectfully,

I have a suggestion for 3 potent antiviral agents, cheap and readily available, that may prevent viral shedding. No viral shedding? No infectivity. The concept is  that EVERYONE should take these items. Two of the items also positively affect heme binding. Covid-19 binds to heme causing 02 desaturation, lung failure and death.


First a short bio:


Dr. Josh Backon was affiliated with the Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine
for over 33 years. He has a good track record (84+ publicat ions quoted by over 750 other researchers

In the 1980's he was Consulting Editor of the Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology, Editor of Reviews in Pure and Applied Pharmacological Sciences, and Associate Editor of the International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health. From 1990- 2004, he was a consultant on emergency planning and management at Israel's National Police Headquarters with Nitzav Mishneh Danny Fisher.

4/13/20

Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. Director, NIAID

Dear Dr. Fauci:

As a fellow graduate of Regis High School	(b)(6)  and very active alumnus, I am writing to you out of deep concern for our nation. I am reading reports in The NY Times that President Trump may be considering firing you for telling the truth about the negative consequences of delays in mobilizing the American response to the coronavirus threat. The Times had run articles in recent days detailing the pertinent facts that place the blame

for this delay squarely on President Trump . We can reasonably infer that significant loss of life and financial harm resulted from this delay.

The mission of Regis was to mold young men with leadership potential to be "men for others" in the Jesuit tradition. To achieve that goal Regis also sought to hone our intellectual talents and imbue us with Christian morality to succeed throughout our lives in a persistent pursuit of excellence, which embodies the truth. A mission to relentlessly pursue and proclaim the truth.

The fact that you have consistently and courageous ly pursued that mission during one of the darkest times in our history explains the extraordinary admiration in which you are held by millions of Americans. You have won their confidence , which has enabled so many to make exquisite sacrifices to win this crucial battle. People will follow heroes, which is precisely how the vast majority views you.

I am writing because I want you to know how important you are to America. We cannot lose you and we can not lose the value of truth. Truth must prevail or our precious democracy is in grave peril.

Consequently , and I know I speak for the vast majority of Americans whose decency is beyond question, if Donald Trump seeks your removal, please resist for the sake of our nation. An appeal to the populace will not go unanswered. Religious leaders will flock to your defense, as will the media and leading political leaders, including Biden and Cuomo. Republicans can not afford to alienate what you stand for. Jeopardizing the Catholic vote would be suicide.

In closing , know how proud all Regians are of you. You will always be an
inspiration to those who understand the value of service to others. Our prayers are with you.

You'll note that both of these are yours, so this email may be unnecessary. If so, apologies for adding to your (what much be crazy) inbox.

Item 1: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research
(NEW)

Activity Type: Strategic Plan

Summary: A new strategic research plan from the National Institutes of Health aims to build on
- and accelerate - new and existing research efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19, as well as understand the underlying causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) .The Plan prioritizes research to improve fundamental knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease, develop diagnostics and assays, characterize and test therapeutics, as well as develop safe and effective vaccines targeted toward decreasing disease incidence, mitigating morbidity, and prevention mortality from this disease .

Impact on COVID-19 Pandemic Response: The strategic plan outlines a research plan targeted at prevention and mitigation of COVID-19 disease.

Item 2:NIH study validates decontamination methods for re-use of N9S respirators Activity Type: Significant scientific finding
Summ ary:  NIAID/NIH-funded study shows that N95 respirators can be decontaminated
effectively and maintain functional integrity for up to three uses. Researchers tested the decontamination of small sections of N95 filter fabric that had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Decontamination methods tested included vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), 70-degree Celsius dry heat, ultraviolet light, and 7fJ'/o ethanol spray. All four methods eliminated detectable viable virus from the N95 fabric test samples. The results will be posted on a preprint server (timing TBD). The findings are not yet peer-reviewed but are being shared to assist the public health response to COVID-19.

Impact on COVID-19 Pandemic Response: Study shows that respirators could be used multiple times (2-3 times depending on decontamination  method)

Colleagues,


As discussed this afternoon, please find attached the POC sign-up sheet (tab 1; tabs 2-3 list the various proposals by category, theme, and IC), the IC-specific proposals, and the economic recovery
proposals .We ask that you please complete the POC sign -up and send it to Jordan Gladman
.		-by S pm on Wednesday April 15. We will then collate and distribute the
compIeted spreadsheet to the Chairs for each of the themes and post it on the ICD SharePoint site.The
individual proposals are imbedded in the pdf as folders sorted by theme.If you feelyour proposal would
fit better with a different working group, please feel free to engage with them.


We ask that,once the POCs have been have been identified, you quickly assemble to begin refining and synergizing your proposals . Each Chair should coordinate with their group to develop a 2 page max summary of the theme's research, along with a single combined budget. The summary should integrate the IC proposals as much as possible; however, it is fine (for valid/justifiable reasons) to describe a few unique projects that fall under the theme as well. That is, if they don't make sense to integrate,you don't have to,but please be sure to include them in the summary.These summaries should be sent to Larry and me (cc Jordan Gladman) by noon on April20. We wil l build off these summaries to generate a document for Francis' review, which we ultimately hope will be informative as we prepare for a  potential fourth supplement.

The ask in short:
 April 15 at 5 pm - send your POCs to Jordan, who will then distribute the completed spreadsheet to the chairs
      April 20 at 12 pm -chairs to send a 2 page summary of their theme (with combined budget) Best,

Dear Dr. Fauci,


My name is Ray DuBois and in addition to being the Dean of Medicine here at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, I chair the Board of Scientific Councilors for the NCI. The mask wearing policy for our Health System is developed by our infection control group and not by the College of Medicine.

Currently, we have a "voluntary" mask wearing policy for the health system and our main University Hospital. Based on your recent comments about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of COVID- 19, do you agree that keeping this voluntary is the correct approach?

Obviously, your opinion here is extremely well respected and Iwould like for us to provide the safest environment possible for our faculty, employees and patients.

Subject: Announcement--ASM's COV ID-19 Research Registry Dear Tony and NIAID friends -
the mission of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) to promote and advance the microbial
sciences has perhaps never been more clearly in focus than during the current SARS-CoV -2 pandemic. Accelerating basic research is key to ASM's mission- it is where cure and prevention begin. It is impressive how rapidly research on SARS-CoV-2 /COV ID-19 has advanced injust a few weeks , but easily accessing new and relevant research has been a challenge for basic researchers . When ASM's Council on Microbial Sciences held a COVI D-19 summit to identify the most significant scientific work on the virus, the coronavirus researchers and clinical microbiologists raised the need for the scientific community to curate important COVID-19 research.


ASM is exc ited to announce the launch of the COVI0-19 Research Registry, a platform curated and vetted by experts in the field of virology and related disciplines to provide immediate access to top COVID-19 research.


Iam proud that Lynn Enquist, Ph.D., Henry L. Hillman Professor in Molecular Biology , Princeton University and former ASM President, will serve as Chief Curator for this Registry. Dr. Harold Varmus, Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine has agreed to join us as Chief Consultant on the project.




We are honored to have the following as Assistant Curators-in-Chief :
 Rozanne M. Sandri-Goldin , Ph.D., Chancellor's Professor , Microbiology & Molecular Genetics,
University of California, Irvine and Editor-in-Chief of ASM's Journal of Virology
 Vaughn Cooper, Ph.D., Professor, Microbiology & Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh,
and current ASM Board member

The entire curatorial board is listed on the Registry site.

ASM is proud to add this initiative to our ongoing efforts.Through its capillary network of clinical microbiologists around the country and the world, ASM has accelerated communication and cleared roadblocks to ramp up SARS-CoV-2 testing.We continue to work closely with our dedicated colleagues, the indefatigable clinical microbiologists manning the front lines in hospitals and testing labs during this unprecedented global emergency. We send our thanks-and admiration--to these ASM members who are contributing directly to saving lives in this perilous time.


Our COVID-19 resource page provides important ASM updates and current information on the coronavirus.  We are also working with the news media to provide authoritative ASM experts and reliable material on the microbiology of viral epidemics. ASM jo urnals is also providing free access to more
than 50 research articles published over the last year in our 16 scholarly journals and expediting review
for submitted papers related to coronavirus , ensuring that new research is quickly made available to the scientific community .

We are hoping that researchers will find the COVID-19 Research Registry a useful resource.We look forward to your comments , questions or suggestions , since your input will be critical for improving this platform and making it usefulfor the scientific community. All feedback can be sent to
covid 19registrv@asmusa.org . We are all in this together. Sincerely,

Carolyn:
  Thanks for the note. I understand that you will be hearing from Francis Collins on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) that we have put together to comb ine the resources and assets of industry and the academic commu nity tha t is laq ely supported by NIH, particularly NIAID in the context of COBID-19 . It is the functional equivalent of a National Strategy. We at NIAID and to some extent other institutes are leveraging our vast clinical trials networks that we built for other infectious diseases, particularly, but not exclusive ly HIV/AIDS, to provide the capacity to conduct clinical trials (NIH-sponsored as well as industry-sponsored) for both vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. For your interest, I am attaching a copy (not yet released) of the NIAID Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research. It is an outline that will be supplemented w ith an implementation plan.
Best regards,
Tony

Hello Dr. Fauci,
This is Melissa Mollet, reporter with NBC4 in Washington. I hope you are well - and safe - and are hanging in there during this unprecedented time. You. have been doing  an  incredibl ejob.
I know you're getting a million emails, so my apologies in advance. I really think this information (attached and below) could help and I feel a responsibility to pass it along.
There is an extremely promising COVID-19 therapy being used right now in Italy.
The creator is a client ofl	(b) C6l Bethe-sda law firm. The managing member
of that finn, Jeremy Schulman, is CC'd on this e-mail. The creator is willing to work
with the NIH to quickly bring his therapy to the U.S.
Please reach out with any questions at all. Best-

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Therapy for COVID-19; Results of Trial in Italy Melissa,
I wanted to expand a bit on the COVID-19 therapy I mentioned and provide some information about the man who is developing it. Hoping that you can get this into the right hands, as it seems like a very promising lead in this fight .

The therapy, invented by Professor Claudio De Simone, has shown extremely encouraging results in a preliminary trial at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University "La Sapienza" in Rome, Italy. Professor De Simone convinced the doctors there to start a trial on patients affected by COVID-19.Considering the excellent results obtained, the number of patients enrolled is increasing day after day. Our firm became aware of these results directly from Professor De Simone, who has been a client of our managing partner, Jeremy Schulman, since 2015.

The formulation employed in these patients at the La Sapienza Infectious Diseases Clinic is manufactured in France and known as "SIVOM IXX." The product is a specialized blend of eight different freeze-dried bacteria with considerable antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Patients admitted to the clinic at La Sapienza, presenting as positive for COVID-19 and with the typical symptoms of the disease, are being treated by oral bacteriotherapy utilizing SIVOMIXX. In each case, SIVOMIXX administration was followed by a dramatic improvement in their conditions. The key takeaways are that use of SIVOMIXX correlated with fewer deaths (zero in the treated group), fewer patients transferred to the ICU, and a dramatically reduced risk of patient intubations.The sponsors of the trial using SIVOMIXX are now beginning to enroll patients with severe cases who have been admitted to the ICU.

Attached to this email is a confidential dossier about the SIVOMIXX product and a summary of the ongoing study. Upon request, Iam also able to send you an Excel file containing the raw data from the study, so NIH can review them, with the understanding that this should be treated as "highly confidential."  Since the clinical trial is continuing in Italy, we expect to have results covering additional patients on a rolling basis. The researchers conducting the study intend to publish their results in the coming weeks. However, considering the pandemic and the lack of effective treatment options, we want to make NIH aware of Professor De Simone's therapy without any delay.

SIVOMIXX is a relatively new formulation developed by Professor De Simone, currently in limited commercial production at a manufacturing facility in France. Professor De Simone has sufficient supply available to utilize with 100-150 COVID-19 patients immediately. Professor De Simone could, on his own, arrange a small-scale supply to use with hundreds of additional patients in the United States. He is willing to provide his current inventory of the product to the United States government. He expects that the Trump administration could quickly confirm the efficacy of SIVOMIXX to significantly improve symptoms of COVID-19 and reduce the duration of patient hospital stays. After that, Professor De
Simone is willing to collaborate with the administration to bring a large-scale production of SIVOMIXX for use throughout the United States, Italy (where he was born), and
Switzerland (where he lives). Professor De Simone already has ongoing partnerships with a

number of manufacturing companies, including one in the United States, for the production of another one of his products (Visbiome, referenced below). With appropr iate guidance and instruction from the Trump administration, we believe the U.S. manufacturing companies could re-tool to produce SIVOMIXX on a large scale within several weeks.

Professor De Simone (more information about him below) and Jeremy will do whatever it takes to bring this critical therapy to as many Americans as possible on an urgent basis. Jeremy can be reached at anytime on his cell phone-	(b) (

Thanks so much for passing this on. Best,
Jake




About Professor De Simone. Professor De Simone is a world-renowned expert in gastroenterology and the inventor of several highly successful probiotic medical foods. Until 2010, he was an Associate Professor for the Infectious Diseases Group at the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the University of L'Aquila, Italy. Subsequently, he was appointed Head of the Infectious Disease Department and Director of the AIDS Coordination Group of the Abruzzi region, Italy. He is currently a retired Professor of Internal Medicine, still collaborating with the University, and a Fellow of the American Gastroenterology Associat ion. Professor De Simone's research specialties have been in the fields of immune-pathogenesis of infectious diseases. He has published the results of his research activities in over 200 scientific articles, reviews, case reports, and book chapters.
Professor De Simone is both a researcher and a medical practitioner. He tests his laboratory hypotheses in the university hospital clinic on patients with serious diseases. He was responsible for controlling the AIDS pandemic in Italy's Abruzzi region in the 1990's.

Products developed according to Professor De Simone's know-how have shown positive results in patients with serious diseases .One of his signature formulations, known as the "De Simone Formulation," is now sold in the United States as "Visbiome." The De Simone Formulation has been the subject of more than 70 published human clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy in managing severe gastrointestinal symptoms from such diseases as ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and liver diseases. Concerning pouchitis, the De Simone Formulation is recognized by the world's professional gastroenterology societies as a "standard of care," an achievement that no other probiotic substance previously has attained. The De Simone Formulation became the "gold standard" in its therapeutic class. Its role in patient care has been endorsed in the guidelines published by the American Gastroenterology Associat ion ("AGA"), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization ("ECCO"), and the British Society of Gastroenterology, as well as in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Iam writing this letter on behalf of the community of infectious diseases specialists    of Georgia to express our deepest respect to you.  recall with great pleasure all our previous meetings, especially the last on e in 20l 7, when I, together w ith my team members , had an opportunity to visit you at NIH.

We are grateful to you and your team for the most important contribution to establishing US-Georgia biomedical  collaboration that significantly increased our country's research and practical capacities. Your persona l role in combating HCV and other emerging epidemics such as SARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola, cannot be overestimated . I am confident that your leading role in this fight against COVID-19 will be cmcial for defeating tlie pandem ic not only in the Un ited  States, but around the globe.

We closely follow your briefings and interviews on COVID-19 (including recent very interesting conversation with Dr. Howard Bau chn er at JAMA) and as always yom views are very apt and to the point. We fully agree that the approaches you suggest are the most effective way to defeat the pandemic. Most importantly your recommenda tions are applicable not only to the United States, but to other countries as well and we eagerly take them into consideration whi le planning our strategies here in my country of Georgia.

I would like to use this opportunity to update you on COVID- 19 situation in my home country of Georgia: The country quickly responded to this threat first by stopping flights with China inJanuary, followed by more strict measures after the first case was diagnosed on February 26. These measures included national lockdown, active contact tracing, isolation and quarantine . The Government of Georgia appoi nted me to lead the Nat ional Committee on the clinical management

of COVID-19. Our effort to contain the spread of the virus had been effective so far with 296 cases of COVID-19 and 3 lethal cases reported up to now.

We are impatiently awaiting results of vaccine and therapeutic trials supported by NIAID, which I am confident will help to defeat this pandemic disease. On our side, Georgia is committed to make its modest but important contribution to the global efforts.

Sincerely,

Tony,
Ihaven't wanted to bother you, but wanted to say thanks for all you are doing, and hope you are at least
to a small extent finding a way to take care of yourself.
 H is hard at work at (b)(6)on a couple of coronavirus projects, so we're counting on him. Of course any time you want to write something, our page is available .
Warmly,
Fred

Hi Tony,




It's been good to see all the calls for ramping up a public health workforce to manage contact tracing and other aspects of the second phase of the response. Iwanted to let you know that Peter Kilmarx has been calling for the formation of a "U.S. COVID-19 Response Corps" since March 21 (unrelated to NIH work) . FEMA could hire thousands of temporary workers quickly with existing authorities and funding. CDC could provide training and technical assistance. The wor kforce would be deployed to and managed by state and local health departments at their request. There's a lot of enthusiasm for this from Jeff Duchin in Seattle, to Tom Frieden, CSIS, ASTHO , and 40 members of Congress (bicameral, bipartisan) who sent a letter to FEMA asking them to do this. The 7,000+ recently evacuated Peace Corps  volunteers could be one recruiting source . Another approach is for CDC to fund state and local authorities for those who are able to hire at this speed and scale.There's more information in the string below.

This wor kforce issue is now such a critical part of the response, Iwanted to share with you what we've learned and offer to helpin any way.

Tony, all of NIH is so proud of your leadership and rooting for you to get this outbreak under control. Please keep up fight and let us know if and how we can help.

Warm wishes, Roger

Updates:
1. Johns Hopkins and ASTHO released "A National Plan to Enable Comprehensive COVID-19 Case Finding and Contact Tracing in the U.S." calling for 100,000 contact tracers. (Kudos!) "Potential workforce recruits may include ... Peace Corps members."
http://www . centerforhea lthsecu rity.org/our-work/pubs archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/a-nationa 1-
plan-to-enable-comprehens  ive-COVI D-19-case-fi nding-and-contact-tracing-i  n-the-US.pdf
2. WaPo article: "A plan to defeat coronavirus finally emerges, but it's not from the White House" covers the JHU/ASTHO plan and notes: "Experts [CSIS] have proposed transforming the Peace Corps into a national response corps that could perform many tasks, including contact tracing." [Not quite accurate. Peace Corps would be unchanged, but the evacuated volunteers would be hired into COVID-19 response.]
3. NY Times editorial from Tom Frieden calls for a "giant public health effort." "Recruits could include Peace Corps volunteers who were brought home when the pandemic spread." https :l/www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/ opinion/cdc-coronavi rus.html
4. Bill introduced by Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)
would require federal agencies and departments facing special hiring needs during the pandemic to establish a process to expedite hiring of returned Peace Corps volunteers https:l/riponadvance.com/stories/collins-bipartisan-bill-would-ensure-benefi    ts-for-evacuated­ peace-corps-vol unteers/
5. From March 29: Policy report from former FDA Commissioners Scott Gottlieb and Mark
McClellan calls for "massively" scaling contact tracing. "Surge the existing public-health workforce to conduct case finding and contact tracing." https://www.aei.org/research­ products/report/na tional-coronavirus-response-a-road  -map-to-reopening/
6. Mark McClellan responded to my email yesterday: "I'd suggest adding outreach to mayors and county execs if that hasn't happened yet. They are really on the front lines for this next phase."
7. Iunderstand legislation is in the works, but don't have details.
8. No news from FEMA or indication to my knowledge that they are planning a substantial ramping up of staffing.
9. A key limitation on the impact of contact tracing will be the relative importance of asymptomatic spread.

10. A note on serology: The current U.S. cumulative incidence is 0.169%. The specificity of FDA EUA Cellex test is 95.6%. Not accounting for undiagnosed cases, Positive Predictive Value is only 3.5%. If underdiagnosis is 10:1,the PPV is still only 26.8%. Will be higher in higher-risk individuals, of course.

Any other updates please send to me.

+John Auerbach, president and CEO ofTrust for America's Health


Thanks all for the robust discussion. Some updates:
1. ASTHO sent the attached memo to Congress today RE: Contact Tracing Workforce calling for "flexible long term and emergency supplemental funding to expand the .. . contact tracing workforce" at state, local,and related levels. It recommends against using FEMA for hiring. ASTHO notes that currently there are only 2,200 DIS nationwide while JHU estimates that 100,000 contact tracing employees are needed to address COVID-19 in the immediate future. The memo mainly calls for 1) $3.6 B emergency funding through the CDC Crisis Cooperative Agreement to eligible jur isdictions, plus 2) a $4.S B annual Public Health Infrastructure Fund.
2. Resolve to Save Lives (Tom Frieden) is advocating for CDC to have the needed authority and
political support to provide training, systems, and technical expertise, while the CDC Foundation and ASTHO provide staffing through direct assistance to health departments.
3. CDC could support curriculum development and training through the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers https://nnptc . org/ and/or TB Centers of Excellence https:l/www . cdc.gov/tb/education/tb   coe/defau l t.htm

My take: We share the goal of rapidly and substantially ramping up the public health workforce and should emphasize that message. It would be very challenging for any of these potential approaches to reach 100,000 in the short term. Idon't have any special allegiance to FEMA, but their traditional role in emergency response is quickly hiring many thousands of workers. They are hiring now, but not at this speed and scale .CDC and FEMA should have an MOU through which FEMA can hire staff and detail to CDC, but they don't seem to be pursuing. One model could be FEMA detailing staff to state and local authorities to manage the hiring process. FEMA is proud of their ability to get people from "door to desk" in one week .This would not be "federalizing" contact tracing or other public health activities. In all cases, the invitations and the oversight would come from the state and local authorities, who are
best able to decide what mechanism(s ) work for them. Lastly, this concept includes more than contact tracing. Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN) in her podcast Wednesday noted that the state 211 call line has gone from 2,000 to 25,000-35,000 calls per day. So this concept would still have a role even if not direct public health functions.

Thanks, PK

Subject: COVID-19 Response Corps - CDC calling for public health army

Thanks Craig.This NEJM article is mainly about heath care workers, but does mention other roles in social support.

Important development: CDC's Bob Redfield is calling for a public health army for contact trac ing after this acute phase:
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/10/831200054/cdc-director-very-agg      ressive-
contact-tracing-need ed-for-u-s-to-return-to-norma  I
It turns out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working on a plan to allow the
U.S. to safely begin to scale back those policies . CDC Director Robert Redfield spoke with NPR on Thursday, saying that the plan relies on not only ramped -up testing but "very aggressive" contact tracing of those who do test positive for the corona virus, and a major scale-up of p ersonnel to do the necessary work.


I'm not sure CDC has the authority, capacity, or political support to hire an army at this time. This is a
traditional FEMA role. CDC can provide training and technical assistance. PK

4. Good conversations w ith Marcus @ASTHO and others today. Important to emphasize that state and local authorities have the lead. This would not be "federalizing" the response. It would be making federal employees ava ilable by request to integrate in state- and local-led activities . Some will welcome the extra hands. Some will prefer to have funding to do their own hiring. Paying salaries of state employees at risk for furlough to work on COVID-19 will make a lot of sense, but won't be enough. Need a menu of options .
5. Many concepts and plans for public health and social response are being circulated. All of them
will need an expanded workforce.


Outreach:
6. I'm in touch with someone in Adam Boehler's office. Other outreach welcome.
7. Iemailed Peggy Hamburg. No reply yet. Other outreach welcome.
8. Anyone who can contact Scott Gottlieb?

Here's a report about a challenge Ididn't see until this morning. Idon't know if grants to state and local authorities would be quicker than federal hiring by FEMA. Either way,the workforce is needed, but will take longer than one would like.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/c limate/fema-staff-shortage-coronavirus .html
FEMA, Racing to Provide Virus Reliet Is Running Short on Front-Line Staff

WASHINGTON - The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the office leading the federal government's coronavirus response nationwide, is running short of employees who are trained in some of its most important front -fine jobs, according to interviews with current and former officials.

At the same time, the agency has been forced to halt a major hiring initiative, and has closed training
facilities to avoid spreading the infection.

The number of available personnel who are qualified to lead field operations hasfallen to 19from 44 in less than six weeks, and staff members have been pulled from responding to other disasters, but training centers in Maryland and Alabama have been shuttered until mid -May. In addition, an effort to recruit new employees called "Harness" is on hold, according to a senior administration official with direct knowledge of FEMA's operations . ...

Craig Fugate, who ran the agency during the Obama administration, said FEMA's ability to deploy enough people was a significant challenge. "Can it be done? Yeah," Mr. Fugate said. "Will it be pretty? No."

Subject: UPDATES: Next steps on COVID-19 Response Corps


Thanks all for our call Friday. {Glenn, Jonathan, Craig, Jeremy, Roger, Anna, Suzanne, Eileen,Mich<aieL)

A few items from the call:
 Jonathan reported Sen Markey's office working on legislation for 10,000+ (?) response workforce
 Michael reported positive response from National Governors Association
 Eileen reaching out to Tom Bossert. Adam Boehler not yet. Shared Op Ed in WSJ emphasizing
testing -  https://www.wsj.com/articles/testi  ng-is-ou r-way-out-11585869705
 Jeremy has an OpEd in Daily Beast with Beth Cameron - https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-shows-we-need-an-apollo-project-for-public­ health
 Craig in touch with Durbin's office. IL has ongoing need for large workforce. Much easier to get staff from feds. Slower to hire at state level. MA implementing 1,000-person contact tracing effort.
 John in touch with Pelosi's office, Delaura, Conf of Mayors, League of Cities.
 Other potential champions -ASTHO, APHA, Josh Scharfstein @JHSPH
 General agreement that for bipartisan emergency approval should emphasize near-term (e.g., 2 year) imperatives of COVID-19 and economic emergencies, not a new permanent work force.
 General agreement that Peace Corps is the low-hanging fruit, but not all 7,000 RPCVs would do
this and the need is much greater.
 CSIS OpEd with Ami Bera (D-CA) and Susan Brooks (R-IN) coming out in Politico or CSIS website  by  Monday

Other updates:
 Telcon Friday with Brooks staffer. They are putting together legislation, ideally bipartisan w ith Bera. Now fully briefed on CRC concept and potential implementation model. Clarified not duplicative of USPHS Ready Reserve Corps which is now authorized but not being implemented (to my knowledge) and would be different profile, i.e., USPHS has physicians, nurses, engineers, etc.
 Telcon Saturday with CDC COVID-19 Chief Medical Officer. Confirms many are thinking about the workforce issue. Notes that CDC unlikely to "own," but great suggestion to engage CDC­ funded National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers for training. https://nnptc.org/ with eight centers around the country. CRC concept may be brought to national response discussions with FEMA in Washington DC.
 FEMA contacts report they are hiring RPCVs, but do not report major speed up or scale up.
FEMA recruiting email attached.
 Charles shared Vanessa Kerry OpEd emphasizing same themes : response workforce and jobs:
https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/04/01/massachusetts-general-hospital    -infectious-
disease-tea m-caIls-on-state-to-ha mess-people-power I


Next steps:
 Executive-support/impetustoFEMAtoincreasespeedandscale
 Legislation - new appropriations for FEMA or CDC if needed
 National advocacy- media, opinion leaders
 Demand signal - state and local authorities requests
 Implementation and management details working out


Overall goal: Greatly increase COVID-19 response workforce to control disease and provide jobs . A COVID-19 Response Corps would be a (big) part of solution. RPCV ideal first cadre for CRC.


Please share any corrections, updates, suggestions.

Subject: NEWS: Congressional letter to Peace Corps, CNCS, and FEMA on COVID-19 Response Corps


Hi all,
Big news. Herewith is a letter signed by 40 members of Congress asking FEMA, Peace Corps, and AmeriCorps to form a "COVID-19 Response Corps." This is now in the public domain. Press release forthcoming .

Please save the time for Zoom call 8 am tomorrow on next steps.

The National Peace Corps Association is hoping to create and fund a group that draws on the evacuated volunteers and their skills to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in the United States. Workers would take on work like tracing the contacts of diagnosed individuals, monitoring the health of those in quarantine and staffing call centers. An agency such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or AmeriCorps could potentially manage the group, says Blumhorst, who has been advocating for the project. Salaries could come from funding that's already been allotted to the COVJD-19 response but hasn't yet been spent. The NPCA has discussed the idea with the offices of several members of Congress that are receptive and supportive, Blumhorst says, and they're planning to speak with more congresspeople and federal agencies and also hope to draw public attention to this potential project.

Hi all and thanks for your support for a U.S. COVID-19 Response Corps engaging returned Peace Corps volunteers (RPCV). The latest (March 26) 2-page concept note attached.




Updates:

l. Steve is working on getting the OpEd out in press and/or on CSIS website by Tuesday. We'll let
you know.
2. Glenn and Charles have found very good receptivity on the Hill.
3. I've had a couple very good calls with FEMA folks at senior levels (extensive RPCV network).
They are already reaching out to RPCV and are well funded. They can get an RPCV on board in a week. They have a few different hiring mechanisms that would be appropriate.The scale and speed need to be  ramped up substantially.
4.  I've reached out to contacts at nationa l mayors and governors associations with no reply. Also
no reply from CDC (Jernigan and Schuchat).


Next steps - when OpEd comes out, amplify multiple levels to publicize and create demand. The need for this is great. The feasibility looks very good.
Please share your suggestions .


Thanks to all,
PK

Thanks Charles. This is very helpful.


I've updated the concept note - attached. Now a two-pager. Added training and prevention bullet. Decreased the numbers and budget based on feed back to date. Draft OpEd forthcoming .

Grateful if others can advocate as they are able (and others of us are not).


Glenn - please add anything on your meetings on the hill yesterday, the FEMA call, or advocacy plans. My takeaway is that a FEMA disaster corps or FEMA-Americorps Corps is feasible.
 Call yesterday with Glenn and former FEMA staff: George Haddow and Micheal Coen
o FEMA Corps is a partnership of FEMA and Americorps with about 1,200-1,800 members. Part of Americorps. FEMA pays 100%. Mainly younger, lower-skilled supervised work.
o FEMA reservist disaster corps has 3,000-4,000 members. Mostly shorter-term deployments as temp employees. Many retired military. Can be activated with State of Emergency declarat ions.
o FEMA currently has sent 3-4 liaisons to each state. Disaster corps not activated. o Onboarding 5,000 would be a big lift. Peace Corps has seconded staff to other
agencies in past, so this could be an option .
o Only private sector partner for FEMA is Red Cross. Not recommended for this.


More input:



 Jen Kates (KFF) and her colleague Josh Michaud - "think it is a great idea"
 Tom Frieden -"It's a good idea."
o Robynn Leidig, Manager, Strategic Initiatives, Resolve To Save Lives - "Compelling idea and worth exploring"
 Concern about risk to RPCVs, training and oversight needed
 lack of PPE, best to focus on tasks that don't need PPE
 Resentment of current staff worried about threat to their jobs
 Fairness: should open to others - Amer icorps, VISTA, CDC PHAP, CSTE fellows, USAID Global Health Fellows
 Management absorptive capacity limited at CDC. Consider ASTHO/ NACCHO or PHI.

Great feedback, Peter. More from Vanessa Kerry:


"Initial reaction is that this is fantastic and Iwould be happy to help in any capacity to support it. Please let me know how. Devil is in the details and the training of course. Truly a smart idea though"

Volunteer) could help implement.


Glenn - good luck on the Hill today. Will be eager to hear about the reception. Some feedback from others:
 John Monahan (Georgetown) - "Very creative, kudos!"

o Try to get authority on one of these COVID-19 response bills for returning Peace Corps folks to be redeployed notwithstanding other provisions of law.
o Explore whether CRC could be incorporated into the programs FEMA already has
to bring in short-term employees to help with emergency responses.
o Some functions (home-delivered meals, staffing call centers, homeless populations
and shelters) would more sense to supplement programs run by Americorps.
o Cost seems high.


 Scott Dowell (Gates Foundation) - "A good and important idea"

o Need a massive surge in the public health and community testing workforce over the coming months.
o They are considering engaging the 30,000 medical students through AMSA (American Medical Student Association) .

 Tom lnglesby (Johns Hopkins) - "A fantastic idea and am very supportive"

o Important issue to be worked through: How to address risk to individuals involved? (My response :training, equipping, and monitoring. Will add to next iteration of concept note. Note that Singapore has had no infections in HCW and in China after January/Wuhan, most HCW infections were from home, not from work.)
o Tom's working on concept to engage presumably immune COVID-19 survivors (as
was done with Ebola) .


 Jeremy Konyndyk (CGD) - "Great idea."

o Need to think creatively about how to expand the public health workforce for the coming 18 months, especially for tasks like contact tracing.We'll need to view CDC and local health dept folks not as boots on the ground but rather as force multipliers - sharing their skills with others and mentoring/managing larger teams to extend their reach.

Re LTCs--attached is a draft document listing all the capabilities that need to be in place for
LTCFs to respond to Covid-19.

Developing and disseminating guidance aimed at LTCFs is relatively easy--the failures are
going to be around implementation .


This is one area where assistance would be valuable.

Thanks all for our call and support for this concept. Please let me know any critical additions or
corrections to these notes.


 Jeff Duchin (Seattle) noted multiple possible roles in contact tracing, mitigation with homeless and incarcerated, adverse consequences of social distancing, infection control support, alternat ive care site coordinat ion, lab specimen collection and transport . He shared concerns about infection prevention and their PPE shortage. CDC had 40 people deployed, but they departed . Longer deployments (e.g., >90 days) needed to validat e onboarding and training effort . He will follow up with more detail on potential roles and numbers.
 Angela Dunn (Utah) agreed with roles in contact tracing, also staffing a call center, rural outreach and specimen collection. She said Utah was not a current priority for FEMA and CDC was conducting a transmission study. She shared Jeff's concern about the onboarding effort.
 Cindy Burnett (Utah) mentioned the need for social support in rural settings.
 Craig Conover (Illinois) added that for them the long-term care centers and homeless populations were priority concerns. It would be feasible and helpful to have staff able to collect specimen swabs.
 Charles Holmes (Georgetown) made an analogy to community health workers in Zambia and how much can be accomplished and enhanced with tablet-based approaches, work­ flow apps, and video instructions.
 Steve Morrison (CSIS) emphasized the importance of finding an organizationa l home, mentioning potential challenges for both CDC and FEMA. He noted timing of response packages being considered, the hunger for creative ideas, and urgency for this to be brought forward. He noted potential champions, listed with others below. He thinks the Peace Corps connection is a compelling factor .
 Glen Blumhorst (NPCA) expressed his support and insights on potential champions, e.g., three RPCV in the house. He is going to Capitol Hill tomorrow.
 Jody Olsen (Peace Corps) (prior to the call) expressed interest and noted that Peace Corps has no authority to operate in the United States. (The possibility of an Executive Order

detailing returned volunteers from Peace Corps to state and local authorities was mentioned by others on the call.) She also noted that Barbara Stewart, Director of CNCS (AmeriCorps and V ISTA) has been inviting RPCVs to jo in.

Next steps:
1. Revise document (done, attached) to be shared w ith subject matter experts and potential champions. (There was not an exact delineation of who would share with whom. Iwill aim to CC; or ask for help w ith some contacts.)
2. Will draft Op-Ed in next 2 days.

Subject: COVID 19: Possible main cause of fatalities, it could be not respiratory Good morning Dr Fauci,
I ve been following you on COVID briefings from the White House every night. Itrust your experience, professionality and above all your wisdom in these weeks.

While I am a mechanical engineer and I run my food company fro living, I have been interested and passionate to the global fight to the Coronavirus.

SUGGESTION:Could it be possible that people die of pulmonary micro thrombosi s rather than respiratory issues? If this is the case, this is more a cardiovascular issue than a respiratory, and ventilation or intubation do not count as much as, instead, to give patients some drugs to prevent the
thrombosis,such as ANTI-I NFIAMMATORIES. If you ventilate a lung where blood doesn't get there, may be it's useless! In fact 9 out of 10 die. If the problem were cardiovascula r and not respiratory, then it could be a venous microthrombosis and not pneumonia that determines fatality. And why are thrombi formed? Because there is an inflammation that induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanisms.

Iknow this thesis is right the contrary of some recommendations that several doctors all over the world (in China first) had made so far: no ibuprofene, no anthibiotics etc etc.
But I believe that some researches on the cardiovascular problem induced by inflammation would be worth doing it.

An apology for my English. Thank you for your attention,

Stay healthy! Kindest regards

Nicola

Redfield, Robert R. (CDC/OD)
RE: Comparison of COVID-19 statistics in US vs.China





 Thank you for you note. This pandemic has been extremely challenging for many countries around the globe including China and the USA. I can only say that I (and I am sure that Bob Redfield feels the same way) prefer to look forward and not to assign blame or fault. There are enough problems ahead that we must face together.
Best regards,
Tony

Subject: RE: Comparison of COVID-19 statist ics in US vs. China Dear Dr. Redfield and Dr. Fauci,
After some hesitation, Idecided to write you this message anyway and hope you don't mind.


Iam concerned about the recent fight between the US and WHO because it may adversely impact the current global efforts in controlling the spread of COVID-19. As we all know, US has been leading WHO's efforts for decades and essentially WHO's role is mostly coordinating responses in low- and middle­ income countries with support from the US and other high income countries. Frankly Iwas looking for leadership from the US CDC rather than WHO when I was doing	(b) (6)
. Until COVID-19 is controlled in all countries,
the infection could come back to hit us in this country again. Therefore it is now the worst time to undermine WHO's global coordinating capabilities.

What I learned from my former colleagues and friends in	(b)(6) where Iattended medical school
and obtained my MSc in epidemiology might offer some explanation for the differences in COVID-19 statistics in US vs. China.  Please find attached a couple of articles published by my former colleague
-- 'of which the 1st attachment is a more updated version .
 First, the maximum lockdown in Wuhan that started on January 23 and also in the rest of the entire Hubei province of 59 million people during the subsequent 2-3 days, coupled with maximum efforts in early identification, immediate isolation of identified infected individuals and close monitoring of contacts, did work and had to work according to epidemiological principles. China did it by invoking level 1public health response that was historically reserved for smallpox, plague or cholera, which essentially enabled the entire country to be completely locked down for several weeks . Many villages and townships set up checkpoints to refuse

anyone to come in or go out; a driver from Hubei had to stay on an inter-provincial highway for 20 days surviving by begging instant noodles from people policing exits; all front doors of residents in a township in Hubei were sealed by local government officials and volunteers to prevent them from getting out of their houses.
 Second, there must be under-reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths because the public health and hospital systems in Wuhan and a few other hardest hit municipalities were overwhelmed for one to two weeks; conceivably many infected individuals were not getting a chance for testing and some of them must have died without being identified as COVID-19. I'd say that this kind of under-reporting is unavoidable, especially in the epicenter of a new pandemic. Actually Isuspect that such under-reporting could have happened in this country as well although perhaps to a lesser degree.
 Third, there could be a third category of casualties, that is, patients who were suffering from chronic diseases but couldn't get necessary treatments because hospitals were overwhelmed.
I read a sad story in social media in which a patient who needed frequent dialysis committed suicide by jumping out of his window.  It is highly likely that many such patients died during the lockdown even though Icouldn't confirm the specific case or find any statistics.  There could be many other collateral damages including socio-psychological effects.
Combined, the effect of the maximum lockdown, the under-reporting of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths as well as collateral deaths of other causes that were associated with the lockdown could be several times of the reported statistics from China. Here I'd not say that China purposely under­ reported COVID-19 cases or deaths but rather, China pursued an extreme approach and achieved an extreme result, including severe collateral damages. Of note, Dr. LI Wenliang (the whistleblower) voiced concern on 12/30/2019 and was criticized for having not followed the legally proper reporting process but nevertheless the WHO China Office was informed on 12/31/2019 of a pneumonia of unknown
cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China
(https ://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/noveI-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen  ).


We in the US and many other countries pursued different approaches, which are more humane but less effective in terms of blocking transmissions.  This is the reality, which needs to be communicated with and recognized by the public; to make the humane approaches work as effectively as possible, we need everyone's support and cooperation, which cannot be achieved by blaming China or WHO. The public has to understand that we are in a pandemic, which means that tens of millions are supposed to be infected and millions are supposed to die from it, unless we take necessary actions to block the transmission and to take good care of the infected.

Finally, I'd like to say a few words for public health colleagues in China.  In my personal view, to be fair, they have done their best to inform the global public health community of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China by briefing WHO and many countries as soon as they identified COVID-19 {12/31/2019 - 1/3/2020); they shared the genetic sequence of the virus on 1/12/2020; and the number of scientific and medical publications in English shortly afterwards was unprecedented .

Vol. 230 April 1, 2020 Biden Picks His Running Mate



Press Conference

Former Vice President Joe Biden
April 1, 2020


(Official Transcript)


BIDEN : Good morning everyone. Iam glad to see all you reporters sitting 6 feet from each other. I know it is burdensome, but we must work together to defeat this awful Zika . . . Rebola. . . the flu . . . er, what?,  .. . Imean, you know, the Coroner virus .

Speaking of the current virus crisis . . . boy that has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? . . . it a lmost rhymes

. . .Iwould like to announce my pick of a running mate; Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of NIH since 1984.. . almost twenty .. . er . . . many years ago.





Now before Istart to answer your questions, let me give you some reasons for my choice .


Number 1: Dr. Fauci is smarter than Iam, but Iam ta ller and younger than he is.


Number 2: He is very experienced . He has worked with many Presidential administrations since he came to Washington .. . in the 1980's as Iremember. He told Ronald Reagan about the AIDS
epidem ic, advised two Bushs . . . one of them gave him the Presidential Meda l of Freedom .. . by the way, Ben Ca rson got his medal during that same ceremony, . . . where was I? Oh, yeh ...two     Clintons .. . yes two,remember Hilary's Health Care Plan? . .. and, of course, Obama or two.

Number 3: He gives very good TV interviews,even on Fox News with Sean Hannity trying to mislead the viewers .

Number 4: His medical training has given him that special skill that all physicians must have to succeed - "Always sound right, and if you don't know an answer, make one up." But he is like one of my famous namesakes on Dragnet ... Sergeant Joe Friday . .."Just the facts, Ma'am."

Now I'll take your questions.


[Sounds of shouting, general loud babbling, a baby crying, a chair falls over]


REPORTER:  " Mr. Biden have you moved away from your promise to pick a female running mate?"


BIDEN: Did Isay that? When was that? ... Oh, it was during one of those debates? ... Iwouldn't call it a promise. It was a statement from which Iam now socially distancing myself, and that makes it a very timely question. . ..This social distancing is for the pits. Ihaven't smelled a good head of hair in weeks ...for the record, my test was negative ...and Iwill ensure that women's voices will be heard in my administration by appointing several to my cabinet. Elizabeth Warren naturally will be Secretary of the Treasury. Kamala Harris as an experienced prosecutor would be an excellent head of the Department of Justice . .. Ithink she is Latino too, isn't she? ... Iam not sure about Senator Amy Kolbuchuck from Minnesota and she has great hair, but Marianne Williamson, ... remember, the physic healer...could serve as Chief of the Alternate Universe ...excuse me, Alternate Therapies within HHS. Adding Senator Gillibrand to the cabinet would weigh the group too heavily towards New York, since Dr. Fauci is from Brooklyn. Iwill, of course, appoint Tulsi Gabbard as Ambassador to America Samoa.

REPORTER: "Do you have any concerns about any regrettable incidents in Dr. Fauci's past?"


BIDEN:  Not really. My staff has vetted him very thoroughly. The only whiff of scandal we found was his medical school yearbook picture where he was being lifted by two of his taller classmates so as to appear as even taller than they. None of them were in black face.
 Also some people may have difficulty knowing how

to pronounce his name correctly. It is pronounced as "Fow-chi" with the soft "c" sound common to

many Italian names, ... and as the Senator from Nevada Iwish to say that Ihave many Italian­ American friends who are hard-working,decent citizens, but Imust excuse myself from this Corleone hearing for another important committee meeting ...oh, sorry . . .was Ichanneling the Godfather again? ... a great movie.

There is another small concern, since he is from New York City and his name ends in a vowel people may think he is associated with Rudy Giuliani .... but  we know that he is taller than Mike.

We have completely debunked the New Yorker Magazine stories that Dr. Fauci has recommended internal alcohol to kill the coronavirus since external alcohol really doesn't work. In fact, he only recommended it as an antidote to the daily briefings of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Fauci also noted that internal alcohol effects may be briefer than the briefings, so viewers may repeat a dose PRN (as necessary).

REPORTER: " Is it true that as noted in your background Press Release just handed out that Dr. Fauci was born on Christmas Eve, and are you concerned about any back lash from Trump supporters who regard Trump as the Second Coming."

BIDEN: Dr. Fauci is an American. Even though he was born in Brooklyn, there is no question about his citizenship eligibility for this office. Ithink that a resurgence of the Birther Movement which was so viscously directed at my close friend and mentor, Barrack Obama, . . . there Ifinally got his name out there. . . would be very unfortunate. Next question.

REPORTER: "Has Dr. Fauci made any significant contributions in fields other than virology and

infectious diseases."


BIDEN: Well let me tell you a down-to-earth, fascinating story of one of his most significant contributions. It will be a short one, Ipromise. Since the Coroner virus pandemic has taken over all the headlines, editorial pages, social media memes, political cartoons, TV shows, graphic artist shops, and a lot of other things swamping articles about the Opioid Deaths epidemic, Dr. Fauci has developed a new attention-getting graphic to replace the familiar 1-10 faces of pain levels; the 1-4 faces of Pandemic Panic levels.






1	2	4




REPORTER: "But face 4 is the same as face 2. Isn't that a confusing message."


BIDEN: Exactly


"Thank you Mr. Biden, and Happy April Fools Day."

Dear Tony,
I'm lucky to have thoughtful neighbors. Please see the email that Ireceived from Sue Edwards.  Because of the likelihood that there are so many asymptomatic cases, isn't it time to recommend everyone
where a mask of some kind? Not N95 masks or even surgical masks that should be reserved for first
responders and hospital staff, but some face covering?

Why can't the CDC make a public service announcement that everyone should be wear ing some kind of mask @ in public? It doesn't have to be N95 or even surgical though that wou ld be ideal (as is done in every Asian country) given that the virus is actually aerosolized (several studies confirm this) and that it can be spread by asymptomatic carriers (which account for possibly more than half of the positive cases - we will never know) it seems obvious that food markets are no different from hospitals and in many cases worse since at least in hospitals people are wearing some protective equipment... just say wear a cotton mask, a scarf, a bandanna, a DIV paper towel mask.. whatever- but no one should be going to a market without one and absolutely no one working in a store or stocking supplies or delivering food, packages,mail etc should be allowed to work without something covering the face- this includes pharmacists as well,obviously 0 wtf ls wrong with this country?

What use are gloves? When the offending particles are escaping our faces and floating around for several hours, landing on everything around us... the only place it shouldn't be as critical is outdoors in the sunshine where UV light should deactivate viruses fairly quickly...


Sue

Hope you are all well - and can give me some hope that this message get through the thick skulls of the so called experts... even during the 1918 flu epidemic, everyone wore some facial covering when out in public places - what is going on?

EVERY ASIAN country is employing this approach with much greater success at slowing the rate of transmission - even India!

Hi Toni,


You continue to be tithe role model" for leaders in biomedical research these many decades. I am so proud of your efforts during these remarkable times in history.Thank you! ! ! I cherish those 5 years (1995- 2000) that I served as Director of NIDR (that became NIDCR) when we were able to co-sponsor efforts to utilize sal iva as a n informative fluid for HIV detect ion.
For me that wa s an invaluable opportunity to be part of

Harold Varmus' leadership team and to continue my research within NIAMS.

I was inspired by your public comments a few nights ago on CNN regarding your observations of significant variance in the pathogenesis or phenotypes noted for subsets of critically ill patients with COVID-19 on ventilators in ICU. I was immediately reminded of David Feinberg {CEO of UCLA Health Sciences, more recently
5 years at Geisingers, and currently CEO of Google Health Companies) who used genotyping for populations around Lancaster PA and discovered about 3-4% with undiagnosed genetic diseases that translated into reduced costs of hospitalization, treatments, etc.
Kaiser-Permanente Northern California, and many
other systems, have also used this approach since sequencing has become cost effective . Perhaps a select sample of people who require ICU, and another that require ventilator, might inform the genotype of the most susceptible people and might also inform a target to use to discover what existing drug or therapy could be mobilized. Through your position, might there already be a large data set of whole genome sequences
(e.g. military) that could be rapidly explored using bioinformatics?

As you may recall, my personal research activities have focused on craniofacial diseases and disorders. For example, Osteogenesis Imperfects {0.1.) presents cardiopulmonary disorders in addition to bone and

tooth disorders . Since penetrance varies, cases of rare conditions can illuminate "hidden" SNP abnormalities in key gene clusters (e.g. MHC gene clusters, etc.). Considering lung disorders as you mentioned in your comments about pathogenesis, already known gene mutations that present several major phenotypes including pulmonary diseases could become very useful. Perhaps Francis and others at the NIH could create a trans-NIH approach that is enabled to visit this pandemic from the perspective of human phenotype variance discovered via genomics?

I asked Martha Somerman to explore the talents available at NIDCR (and beyond) related to connective tissue genetic diseases that associate with Types 1and 111collagens, elastics, and hyaluronic acid glycoproteins AND lung tissue fibrosis, etc. She may also reach out to you.

Meanwhile, thank you for your untiring efforts to use science to inform health policy. Of course, let me know if I can be of any use to you .

Always, Hal

Ralph:
  Iam so sorry that I took so long to get back to you. I receive over 1000 e-mails per day and even with staff screening, I do not see them for days.  There is still an issue/problem with serologic tests in that they need to be validated as being sensitive and specific.  Many tests that have been used thus far are not accurate and ARE MISLEADING.  The UK bought millions of these from China and found that they were inadequate.  The FDA is in the process of validating certain tests this week and if they pass, then we can expect to have tests within the next few weeks to do the things that you have suggested.

Subject: COVID-19 Question



Dear Dr Fauci,



Ihope this email finds you well.


Thank you for everything you are doing for our country in these difficult times.



Irealize your time is extremely valuable - especially during these times.



Ihave one question - if you can help me answering it.



Why are serologic tests not made abundantly available during these times?



This will help in so many ways:


- Can it be used to triage healthcare workers? Naturally "vaccinated" healthcare workers may be better triaged to be on the front lines for example, ta king care of COVID-19 patients. (In times of limited PPE, documentation of natural immunity is probably one of the best PPE's out there)


-Another major use for it:


People can be asked to remain home, until they have documentation of natural immunization.


Serologic tests are very cheap, can be mailed, and done at home.


Immunized individuals can carry the test as "proof" of immunity - and may be able to go back to work
etc.



It is just a thought. It may be a very candid question that Iam asking.


But while we are waiting for a vaccine (and this will take several months), some people may be able to benefit from a very cheap test (that can be done at home) to short-circuit that waiting time.



Thank you for everyth ing you are doing to our country, You are such an inpiration to us all.

Iwish you all the best.



Thank you.

We have received a request from the PBS program "American Masters" and Topspin Productions to do a documentary about you.  Their near-term ask is one or two brief v ideo-link phone interviews during the next few months. After the coronavirus pandemic has subsided, they would like to do "a proper sit­ down in which you could tell us the stories that speak to the key moments in your remarkable career."

On the face of it, this might seem to overlap with the Tobias/Hoffman project, but in the end Ithink
they'd be quite different products. Please let me know if you'd like us to seek clearance to proceed.

During this time, we 've been rethinking how we want to proceed with our documentary and have come to realize focusing on you, your experiences over the decades, how you have met every challenge presented  to you, would  give all  of us a  roadmap for the future.

To that end we are now in partnership with AMERICAN MASTERS, PBS' flagship series that profiles and honors outstanding Americans. Together we woul d l ike to produce a comprehen sive look at your life,your experiences and your insights into how to deal with the recurring diseases that continue to plague our lives.

Ihave included below an introductory email from American Masters Executive  Producer, Michael Kantor, which will give you a broader sense of that exceptional PBS series and the extraordinary work they produce.

We all know how limited your time is now -and all of us are so appreciative of what you are doing. We respectfully hope you will allow us to cbronicle your l ife in medicine. We know that as we emerge from this latest crisis -understand ing how you were able to deal

 I am writing today to see if you would allow us to make a film on your life and career.  We would  require very little of your precious time right now, perhaps one or two very brief video-link phone interviews over the next few months, just as you have appeared on Trevor Noah's The Daily Show and spoken with basketball star Steph Curry. Later this year, after the current crisis has subsided, we would find time in your busy schedule for a proper sit-down in which you could tell us the stories that speak to the key moments in your remarkable career.

I am excited to work with Lia Carney and Topspin Productions on this project, because it has been important to me to expand the roster of AMERICAN MASTERS films to include scientists. Over its 33 year history, our series has profiled artists such as Leonard Bernstein, Maya Angelou and Raul Julia, athletes including Billie Jean King and Ted Williams, and now we are presenting the stories of James Watson and Oliver Sacks in our pantheon of great films. Our series is dedicated to telling biographies w ith the utmost care, and for that reason we have been honored with awards like the Emmy, the Peabody, the Grammy and even an Oscar.

We would be honored to have you join us in our public television effort to educate Americans about the domestic and global health issues that have been the focus of your career. This letter is brief because we respect your time, but we sincere ly hope that you will join us in creating a documentary of distinction for a broad and diverse national audience.

Sincerely yours,


Michael Kantor

Dear Professor Anthony Fauci and Professor Kami Kim,
Greetings from Pondicherry,India. This is Dr K Neelakantan Viswanathan, Senior Professor of Medicine
in a medical school here.


Going through your excellent chapter, !Chapter 197) in page 1445, on AIDS and related disorders in HPIM-20, under secondary prophylaxis I maintenance therapy for Toxoplasmosis it is said that "it may be discontinued in the setting of effective cART and increases in CD4+ T cell counts to> 200 / microliter for 6 months''.


In page 1615, another wonderfully written chapter, (Chapter 223 ) on Toxoplasma infections, Professor Kami Kim has mentioned that" individuals who have completed initial therapy for TE should receive treatment indefinitely unless immune reconstitution with a CD4 + T cell cont of >200 occurs as a consequence of cART".

Since both feature in the same textbook followed worldwide by medicos, could you please clarify the above?
Istand subject to any corrections.


Hoping that we fight Covid-19 effectively very soon.Stay safe. Regards and best wishes,
Professor Dr K N Viswanathan

Subject: FW: Serosurvey


Hello Dr. Fauci,
I hope you are stay ing well in these trying times.

I'm writing to request a chance to embed with a team doing a coronavirus serosurvey, to tell a public health story from the front lines as I believe I'm uniquely positioned to do. I've made a similar request to the CDC, but the nationwide reach of the NIAID serosurvey might make my proposal easier to consider, so I'm coming hat in hand to you as well.

Twenty years ago, as a temporary CDC employee during a four-month Knight Journalism fellowship, I had the opportunity to take the EIS course in Atlanta and then work on several CDC outbreak and disease investigations. One was a serosurvey on Long Island after West Nile virus had recently emerged in the U.S.
I headed one of a dozen CDC teams that included a driver, a phlebotomist and a health aide from the New York state and Suffolk County health departments. We went door-to-door to consent participants, get blood samples and do interviews on exposure and symptoms.

Iappreciate the tremendous scientific value that serosurveys offer and the kind of attention to detail and study rigor that's needed to get reliable information. I'm also a longtime medical journalist who understands and is sensitive to confidentiality, ethical and privacy concerns. I've been recognized by my peers as a science writing leader.
https:ljcasw.org/casw/article/marilynn-marchione-associated-press-wins-victor-cohn-prize


I've attached some letters from CDC and other health officials regarding my work on the serosurvey, a photo of the EIS and CDC team (that's me toward the right in the front row) and the MMWR report resulting from our work. The field supervisor -- Dr. Anthony Marfin, now with the global vaccine group PATH	CbH	is willing to speak to you on my behalf. Dr. Richard Besser, now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was my fellowship supervisor and mentor at CDC. Others Iworked with include Dr. Anne Schuchat, Dr. John Ward, Dr. Robert Tauxe and Dr. Lyle Petersen.

And of course, you know me from nearly three decades of medical writing, including the
HIV/AIDS government trip to Africa when Tommy Thompson was healthy secretary.


The Associated Press reaches half of the world's population every day. I hope to offer a story that Iand the AP are uniquely able to provide, to show and explain how public health is done and how science is accomplished during a pandemic. Thank you for considering my request.

Thank you Dr.Birx and Or . Fauci:


At a time when America needs it most both of you have courageously stood at the podium at the White House press briefings and explained what we all need to be doing during this paralyzing COVID-19 pandemic . When others have failed to lead, multiple task forces have struggled prioritizing safety first before economics, both of you have tag teamed presenting the data and the analytics of COVID-19 by decoding its complexities and giving us the "honest truth" in language that is easy to understand.The virus will end when it ends and not before. Thank you both for your service to the nation and for doing your jobs with conviction and commitment in doing the right thing - sticking to sc ience and not yielding to politics. America is immensely grateful for both of you telling us all what we need to hear and what we need to do. You are both giants in the world of medicine.

Very appreciative,

Dear M r Fauci ,

We are really wondering over here in Europe why you don't take a dedicated opinion on COVID- 19 and share your opinion at the daily bri efings to the extent of your personal believes.

We really expect you to oppose the president wherever you have a different opinion, which we believe is based on
facts.

Please consider our request and don't lei the president keep spreading his lies to the people of the United States.

We wou ld really appreciate watching you on the briefings telling the nation the trnth that is based on your
experience straight to the point.

Thank you so much,
Daniel Kolliker and acquaintances

Dear Dr. Fauci:

Iwrite simply to thank you and congratulate you for your incredible efforts during the management of this pandemic as it reaches across our nation. The unique challenges that this pandemic has created have also created opportunities , and we here at the University of Nebraska Medical Center have proudly participated with our federal, state and local partners during this COVID-19 pandemic as well as over the last 16 years, having matured an extensive program in the research , education, and clinical components of highly infectious diseases and biocontainment.

The UNMC Center for Global Health Security has been the umbrella organization that has organized all of these components and continues to have strong leadership from retired military public health as well as gifted research scientists from across the nation. As a co-founding partner of NETEC, as a recipient of the Regional Disaster Health Service Awards , and as a close collaborator with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State , we have enjoyed the opportunity to always "lean in" as the need arises.

I am sure your days are full not only of the complex logistics and tension that fill leadership roles at this time but also maintaining a "steady hand on the rudder" as we navigate  these  challenging waters. I think back  to my days  at New York Presbyterian and Cornell Med, knowing that we  are both Cornell Med grads, both did our residency and fellowship training in New York,  and have had the opportunity to interact back so many years ago. I do remember quite well the first time that we met and have always reflected warmly at having even a brief opportunity to interact.

Ido not write to ask for anything but to just simply thank you for all that you continue to do and know that you always have a friend here in Nebraska . I wish you and your family the very best as we continue this journey.


Most sincerely,

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Thank you from the bottom of my heart for highlighting the health disparities and disproportionate burden of disease influencing outcome of Covid-19 infections in African Americans. Participants in my observational, longitudinal,epidemiologic Baltimore-based study, HANDLS https://handls .nih . gov/ are terrified by the level of disease they are seeing in their communit ies across Baltimore. We have been on the phone with and texting participants to educate them,support them in their efforts to get tested, remind them of the importance of social distancing and self-isolation when appropriate to protect their
health.We a re acutely aware of their fragility. Testing in Baltimore is
limited. The National Guard has set up community testing at the Pimlico Race Tra ck; however,although we have deployed our mobile medical research vehicle s to Pimlico in the past to conduct our study, the current crime rate is such that our partic ipants and community residents in general do not go to the Pimlico area especially if they are on foot. The other issue with testing for African Americans and our participants is the need to have a health care provider that one can contract to discuss symptoms to get a referral for testing. The unravelling of t he Affordable Care Act has severely impacted access for African Americans across the nation and especially in Baltimore. Our participants are ca lling my staff clinician and nurse practitioner for referrals if they have symptoms. We have reached out to colleagues at

Health Care for the Homeless, JHU and other medical entities to
facilitate access.


Thank you all you are doing.Since I work in Baltimore, I haven't seen

Dear Tony and Patty:
Responses to Burklow 's questions to me from your group call yesterday:
1) I think we have landed in the right place for the film about your life. Nat Geo, Disney, and Bob Iger himself, all understand the need for discretion now but are wildly supportive about releasing a film that will celebrate the importance of your li fe, science and pub lic health .   wanted the best home, broadest distribution , and strongest team for your film. You have entru sted me with yow· sto1y, so Iju st want to do right by it.  We are really happy with the filming that we have done so far persona .I	CbH	home, school) to work (office etc).
3) The other film we have been working on (ENDING AIDS), which follows globally the HVTN trial s/latest Aids research to complete "the toolbox" is definitely still happening. It is now in pause with COVID-19 ....but will move forward again when we get through this. Filming at research sites in South Africa, US, and Latin America has been great...and when you have time -in the future -I will outline . You obviously are a key subject in ENDING AIDS also, but ENDING AIDS w ill
spend a lot of time with doctors at the field research sites and with volunteers in the trials. The Aids conference and meetings footage we have shot with you will be shared between films, smartly and distinctly. ENDING AIDS will be released a
year plus later than the release of your biographical film-I am focused on your film now. Howard Hughes Medical Institute remains the educational partner on ENDING AIDS. Jn the fall we will finalize the broadcast/streaming  partner for ENDING AIDS. So, bottom line it will be released a year after your film, and wi ll be a film focused on showing in detail w here we are now with aids research and the key
people in the chain from you 10 a young female volunteer in South Africa/a young male volunteer in Binningham.
FILMING REQUESTS for your film now.
4) NO more asking to film with the Task Force.
5) I do have two personal filming requests for you -would it be possible to drive to NIH with you once or twice a week and capture your working/appropriate conversations in the car. That w ill be so helpful narrati vely to tracking your
scientific and communication leadership. The footage we did that first day is truly

great.  We will just tum around and come back after the tide there--- in our follow car (we have NIH access badges). Secondly, wou ld it be possible to sit down with you on camera for 15 minutes once a week (on the weekend?) at the office or on the back deck/some safe location to talk with me inreal time about what you are managing with treatments, vaccines, etc. so we can pull the
scientific/conununicat ion nanative on COVID-19 through your film.
6) We love the live truck and the walks, so whenever that works we will be there.
7) 1NEVER ever want to interfere with the work on the Task force, lives are at stake. IF something doesn't work for filming no questions asked we don't do it, we stop, cancel/pivot. No need to explain, the team here understands and only wants to do what works for you, your team. ..	(b)
With appreciation ,
Janet

Dr. Fauci-

A lmost embarrassed to ask, but would you be w illing/able to speak v i rtua lly to the
American Broncbo-Esophagological Association (abea.net) on Friday April 24th? This year marks the 1oorh anniversary of this venerable organization that brings together clinicians (mainly Otolaryngologists) who care for patients w ith complex upper aerodigestive tract disorders. Our annual National Meeting has been cancelled and we are hosting a virtual meeting it it's stead.

As Otolaryngologists, we are currently and expect to continue to be dramatically impacted by the current pandemic, given that our care for patients routinely includes upper airway endoscopy (30-40 scope procedures a day is routine) which as you know is a high-risk aerosolizing procedure. As I 'm sure you are aware, Otolaryngolgist s have been amongst the hardest hit clinicians in terms of patient-to­ provider transmission of COv1D-19.

Your input  for 10-15 minutes would   be an honor. Discussion  topics could  include general comments  about the pandemic,  a  sense of what to expect  in the corning months and years, and what we can do as medical leaders toprepare for these
changes in the US and abroad.

Ifthis is something you are interested in, with whom on your communicat ions team
could I communicat e?


Thanks so much for the consideration -your brief presence and input wou ld mean a great deal to our society.

Hi Tony,


Ihope that you are doing well despite all that you are dealing with around COVID-19. It has been many years since I had the opportunity to work with you but my job at NIAID was one of my favor ite positions and gave me a great start to my career. So, when I saw the below graphic, it made me smile and I wanted to send you a note.

Itruly appreciate how you are handling the COVID-19 situation. Your comments are a breath of fresh air amidst politics and uncerta inty. With da ily White House press briefings, increased secur ity and scrutiny, 24/7 media interviews a nd great popularity, you seem to be holding up well - as you always do. Your recent interview w ith JAMA's Editor-in-Chief Howard Bauchner was particularly well done and very enlightening.


Thank you for everything that you are doing and please stay healthy! Kind regards,
Mary Jane

A majority of a small group of patients showed improvements after being treated with an experimental coronavirus treatment made by Gilead Sciences, bolstering hopes for finding a treatment for the disease, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine Friday.
The group of patients received the anti-viral drug remdesivir as part of a "compassionate use" trial, not a double-blind placebo-control led tria l which would offer more definitive evidence. Also, the cohort of patients was small, only 53 patients in the United States and around the world .Those limiting factors prevent scientists from declaring that the drug works .
Still, the improvements offered positive news about a drug seen by global health authorities as offering the best shot at becoming a treatment for the disease .
Thirty six patients out of 53 - or two-thirds - showed improvement in oxygen support, trial authors
said. Seventeen of 30 patients who were on ventilators were able to be taken off the life-support machines.
"We cannot draw definitive conclusions from these data, but the observations from this group of
hospitalized patients who received remdesivir are hopeful," said Jonathan D. Grein, MD, Director of Hospital Epidemiology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, and lead author of the journal article. "We look forward to the results of controlled clinical trials to potentially validate these findings ."
While 68 percent of the patients showed improvement in the level of oxygen support they needed, 13 percent died, the NEJM study said .That 13 percent compares favorably to mortality rates of 17 to 78 percent in China among severely ill patients, the authors wrote.

Gilead's stock has been bolstered for weeks by expectat ions over remdesivir .
Remdesivir was discovered by Gilead in the hunt for antiviral drugs about a decade ago, and the National Institutes of Health has partnered with the company to explore its benefits. It was shown to work against an array of viruses in laboratory tests.
It showed effectiveness in primates infected with Ebola but failed in a trial in the Democratic Republican of Congo in humans with the deadly disease . It has shown effectiveness as a preventive therapy in primates for MERS, which is a coronavirus cousin of the Covid-19 virus.
There are no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus, but the FDA has granted an emergency use authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two decades-old anti-malarial drugs. There is scant evidence that the therapy works, but President Trump has repeatedly boosted the promise of the drugs.
Even while multiple full clinical trials of remdesivir continue, Gilead hasbeen swamped with requests for "compassionate use" of the drug. Under compassionate use rules, physicians can obtain experimental drugs for their seriously ill patients when there is nothing else to try.
Gilead said last week that it had enough of the experimental drug on hand to treat up to 140,000 people under compassionate use programs.

How Anthony	Fauci Became America's	Doctor
An  infectious-disease expert's long crusade against some of

"You stay completely apolitical and non-ideological,"  Fauci says.  "I'm a scientis t
and I'm a physician. And that's it. "Illustration by Tyler Comrie. Photograph by Win McNamee I Getty




Just before midnight on March 22nd, the President of the United States prepared to tweet. Millions of Americans, in the hope of safeguarding their health and fighting the rapidly escalating spread of COVID-19, had already begun to follow the sober recommendation of Anthony S. Fauci, the country's leading expert on infectious disease. Fauci had warned Americans to "hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing." Donald Trump disagreed. "WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF," he tweeted.
Trump had seen enough of "social distancing. " In an election year, he
was watching the stock market collapse, unemployment spike, and the national mood devolve into collective anxiety. "I would love to have the country opened up, and just rarin' to go by Easter," he said, on Fox News. "You'll have packed churches all over our country. I think it'll be a beautiful time."
Trump 's Easter forecast came more than two months after the first U.S.
case of COVID-19 was identified, in Washington State, and more than a hundred days after the novel coronavirus emerged, first from bats and then from a live-animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Every day, more people were falling sick and dying. Despite a catastrophic lack of

testing capacity, it was clear that the virus had reached every comer of the nation. With the Easter holiday just a few weeks away, there was not a single public-health official in the United States who appeared to share the President 's rosy surmises.
Anthony Fauci certainly did not. At seventy-nine, Fauci has run the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for thirty-six years, through six Administrations and a long procession of viral epidemics: H.I.V., SARS, avian influenza, swine flu, Zika, and Ebola among them. As a member of the Administration's coronavirus task force, Fauci seemed to believe that the government's actions could be directed, even if the President's pronouncements could not. At White House briefings, it has regularly fallen to Fauci to gently amend Trump's absurdities,
half-truths, and outright lies. No, there is no evidence that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine will provide a "miracle" treatment to stave off the infection. No, there won't be a vaccine for at least a year. When the President insisted for many weeks on denying the government's inability to deliver test kits for the virus, Fauci, testifying before Congress, put
the matter bluntly. "That's a failing," he said. "Let's admit it."
When Trump was not dismissing the severity of the crisis, he was blaming others for it: the Chinese, the Europeans, and, as always, Barack Obama. He blamed governors who were desperate for federal help and had been reduced to fighting one another for lifesaving ventilators. In
one briefing, Governor Andrew Cuomo, of New York, said, "It's like
being on eBay with fifty other states, bidding on a ventilator." Trump even accused hospital workers in New York City of pilfering surgical masks and other vital protective equipment that they needed to stay alive. "Are they going out the back door?" Trump wondered aloud. As a reporter who writes mainly on science and public-health issues,
I've known Fauci since the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic exploded, in the mid­
eighties. He once explained to me that he has developed a method for dealing with political leaders in times of crisis: "I go to my favorite book of philosophy, 'The Godfather,' and say, 'It's nothing personal, it's strictly business.' " He continued, "You just have a job to do. Even
when somebody's acting ridiculous, you can't chide them for it. You've

got to deal with them. Because if you don't deal with them, then you're
out of the picture."
Since his days of advising Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Fauci has maintained a simple credo: "You stay completely apolitical and non-ideological, and you stick to what it is that you do. I'm a scientist and I'm a physician. And that's it." He learned the value of candor early. "Some wise person who used to be in the White House, in the Nixon Administration , told me a very interesting dictum to live by," he told me in 2016, during a public conversation we had at the fifty-year reunion of his medical-school class. "He said, 'When you go into the White House, you should be prepared that that is the last tiine you will ever go in. Because if you go in saying, I'm going to tell somebody something they want to hear, then you've shot yourself in the foot.' Now everybody knows I'm going to tell them exactly what's the truth." Americans have come to rely on Fauci's authoritative presence. Perhaps not since the Vietnam era, when Walter Cronkite , the avuncular anchor of the "CBS Evening News, " was routinely described as the most trusted man in America, has the country depended so completely on one person to deliver a daily dose of plain talk. In one national poll, released last Thursday, seventy-eight per cent of participants approved of Fauci's performance. Only seven per cent disapproved .
On March 23rd, Fauci failed to appear at the daily briefing in the White House pressroom. Twitter promptly lost its mind. #NoFauci became a top trending topic, followed closely by #whereisF auci and
#letTonyspeak. There was speculation that Trump, who is inclined to
fire anyone who disagrees with him or, worse, garners some praise in the media, had lost patience with Fauci. As one of Fauci's old friends told me, "This is a President who doesn 't give a shit about Fauci's accomplishments, his history, or his learning. If anything, they're
negatives."
The truth was less alarming. "I was tied up in a task-force meeting, and we were trying to work out some difficult policies ," Fauci said. "I have no trouble with the President. When I talk to him, he listens." My experience with Fauci suggested that this last statement was perhaps a triumph of pragmatism over accuracy. His priority , as he's inade clear, is

to do what is necessary to save lives. So I was not surprised to receive an e-mail from Fauci the following day, saying that he had been asked to refrain from participating in personal profiles. It seemed that it was one thing for him to talk about the news with reporters or even to chat on Instagram with Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors star. But focussing on himself, rather than on the President, was another thing entirely.
Fauci and Trump are about as odd a duo as American political life has
ever produced . Both men are in their seventies. Both come from the outer boroughs of New York City. Both are direct, even blunt. But that's where the resemblance ends. Fauci has always been a person of unusual discipline. Nearing eighty, he works about eighteen hours a day. Long ago, when his three children were young, he and his wife, Christine Grady, who runs the bioethics department at the National Institutes of Health, decided to maintain the sanctity of family dinners by starting them when he got home from the office, at around nine o'clock. For decades, Fauci has taken long lunchtime runs, but, during the crisis, he's cut back his routine to power walking-and only on weekends. Fauci parses his words with care and believes, above all, in the power of facts and the efficacy of data.
ADVERTISEMENT
David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate and a pioneer of molecular biology, told me, "Tony is unique, in that he has such credibility with politicians that he 's been able to insert hard facts into the conversation. That has been wonderful for our country and the world ." According to David Reiman , a microbiologist at Stanford University who for years has advised the government on biological threats, "Tony has essentially become the embodiment of the biomedical and public-health research enterprise in the United States. Nobody is a more tireless champion of the truth and the facts. I am not entirely sure what we would do without him."


Fauci can be impatient with the compromises of politics. In my conversations with him, he has responded furiously when a dicey amendment, a bogus rider, or a "poison pill" is attached to a public-

health bill. He recalled one congressional provision, in 2016, that tried to make it "legally permissible to fly the Confederate flag at national cemeteries. I am not kidding." When dealing with politicians, he told
me, he relies on the pseudo-Latin expression Illegitimi non
carborundum: Don't let the bastards grind you down. But he has inspired respect throughout the political world and beyond. Fauci 's office walls are covered with scores of photographs of him with
Presidents, senators, visiting Prime Ministers , business leaders, actors. In
October, 1988, George H. W. Bush, during a Presidential debate with Michael Dukakis , was asked who his heroes were. "I think of Dr. Fauci," Bush replied. "You've probably never heard of him....He's a very fine researcher, a top doctor at the National Institutes of Health, working hard, doing something about research on this disease of AIDS. " These days, nearly everyone has heard of Fauci. Pandemic-memorabilia entrepreneurs have put his face on bottle openers, coffee mugs, and bumper stickers: "In Dr. Fauci we trust." The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum has produced a seven-inch likeness of him, partly
to raise money to produce protective gear for medical workers. There's a
Facebook group called Dr. Fauci Speaks, We Listen, and another called Dr. Fauci Memes for Social Distance Teens. A petition has circulated to nominate him as People's "sexiest man alive."
On right-wing social media and talk radio, Fauci has a different image: he is routinely disparaged as a closet lefty who is exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus. "Has anyone else noticed that every suggestion by  Dr. Doom Fauci just happens to also be the worst possible thing for the economy?" the conservative Internet TV host Bill Mitchell tweeted. "That's not an accident folks." An analysis in the Times found more than seventy Twitter accounts that have pushed the hashtag #FauciFraud,
with some tweeting out anti-Fauci bile hundreds of times a day. "There
seems to be a concerted effort on the part of Trump supporters to spread misinformation about the virus," Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington who has studied misinformation , told the paper. "There is this sense that experts are untrustworthy , and have agendas that aren't aligned with the people." Fauci has received so many personal threats that the Justice Department recently approved a security

detail for him. Fauci shrugged it off, telling reporters , "I've chosen this life."
The crisis that the world now faces comes as no surprise to Fauci. On January 10, 2017, ten days before Trump took the oath of office, Fauci delivered the keynote address at a conference at Georgetown University, titled "Pandemic Preparedness for the Next Administration. " After describing his years of managing epidemics, he posed a series of questions to the audience: "Will there be a resurgence of Zika? We're getting into the summer in South America. Are we going to see a resurgence or not? What about influenza? Are we going to get a new pandemic?"
Fauci's last point, he emphasized, was almost certainly the most
important: the possibility that some unknown , powerfully infectious pathogen could emerge to threaten the world . "What about things that we're not even thinking about?" he said. He let the question drift out over the hall. "What is for sure," he concluded, "is that, no matter what, history has told us definitively that it will happen."



On the day that Anthony Stephen Fauci was born , the front-page headline in the Times was "PRESIDENT TO GIVE EMERGENCY FACTS TO NATION ON RADIO." It was Christmas Eve, 1940. The Second World War had begun, and the United States was less than a year away from joining the fight.
Fauci grew up in southwest Brooklyn, first in Bensonhurst and later in Dyker Heights, where his family ran a pharmacy and lived in an apartment upstairs. The pharmacy was across the street from the Shrine Church of St. Bernadette. When Mass was finished on Sundays, Fauci recalled, people would walk over to get prescriptions filled and to buy whatever else they needed for the coming week. Tony 's father, Stephen, dispensed medications, and was known to customers as Doc. His
mother, Eugenia, worked the register, along with his older sister, Denise.
From an early age, Tony spent evenings and weekends riding around the neighborhood on his Schwinn, making deliveries.

Fauci's parents were bo1n in New York; one set of grandparents had emigrated from Naples, the other from Sicily. Anthony first took Communion at the age of seven and was confirmed at twelve. He went to elementary school at Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Bensonhurst. "I had no idea at the time when I was there, being taught by the Dominican nuns, that I would be interested in science," he said. "I was interested in a lot of things, mostly sports, but certainly not science."
In those days, baseball was the social glue of Brooklyn. The borough
was Dodger territory and Ebbets Field was consecrated ground-but Fauci was devoted to the Yankees, who played in the faraway Bronx. In the midst of the coronavirus crisis, I e-mailed to ask about this anomaly, not necessarily expecting an answer. He replied almost instantly. "You probably are unaware, but half the kids in Brooklyn were Yankee fans," he wrote. "We spent our days arguing who was better: Duke Snider versus Mickey Mantle; Roy Campanella versus Yogi Berra; Pee Wee Reese versus Phil Rizzuto and on and on. Those were the days, my friend."
Fauci has often referred to his father as "laid-back," which, if true, must
be a characteristic that skips a generation. "Tony has always been driven," Michael Osterholm, the director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, and a longtime friend ofFauci's, told me. "Whatever he was doing, he had to do it better than anybody else. I don't know if it was certainty or something else. But he was meant to lead. Always. Everyone who knew him knew that. And Tony knew it, too."
In 1954, he began attending Regis, a private Jesuit high school on the
Upper East Side. Rigorous, small, competitive, and tuition-free, Regis is considered one of the finest all-male schools in the country. Fauci thrived there, though the commute between Dyker Heights and Eighty­ fourth and Madison was long. He once estimated that he had spent the equivalent of seventy days of his teen-age life on the various subways and buses he took to get to and from school.
Fauci revelled in the demanding coursework. "We took four years of
Greek, four years of Latin, three years of French, ancient history,
theology," he recalled. He developed an ability to set out an argument

and to bolster it with evidence-good preparation,  it turned out, for testifying before Congress. Last year, at a dinner that Regis held in his honor, he said that the school had taught him "to communicate scientific principles , or principles of basic and clinical research, without getting very profuse and off on tangents."
At the time, though, Fauci had no interest in becoming a doctor. "I was captain of the Regis High School basketball team," he once told me. "I thought this was what I wanted to do with myself. But, being a realist, I very quickly found out that a five-seven, really fast, good-shooting point guard will never be as good as a really fast, good-shooting seven-footer. I decided to change the direction of my career."
At school, Fauci 's accomplished peers were headed to careers in
medicine, engineering, and the law. At home, he was steeped in the humanities:  "Virtually all my relatives on my mother's side-her father, her brother,  and her sister's children-are artists." His mother helped tip the balance. "She never really pressured me in any way, but I think I subtly picked up the vibrations that she wanted very much for me to be a physician," Fauci said. "There was this tension-would  it be humanities and classics, or would it be science? As I analyzed that, it seemed to me that being a physician was the perfect melding of both of those aspirations."
From Regis, Fauci went on to another Jesuit institution, Holy Cross, in Worcester, Massachusetts. His high-school faculty had left him little choice in the matter. "They just wouldn't write a recommendation for you if you wanted to apply to Harvard or to Co1nell, or Columbia," he said. Fauci enrolled in 1958 and was pleased to find that the university took a broad view of premedical studies. He signed up for a program called Bachelor of Arts-Greek Classics-Premed. "It was really kind of bizarre," he recalled. "We did a lot of classics, Greek, Latin, Romance languages ....We took many credits of philosophy, everything from epistemology to philosophical psychology, logic, etc. But we took enough biology and physics and science to get you into medical school."
During the summers, Fauci worked construction jobs. One year, he found himself assigned to a crew that was building a new library at

Cornell Medical College, on the Upper East Side. "On lunch break, when the crew were eating their hero sandwiches and making catcalls to nurses, I snuck into the auditorium to take a peek," Fauci recalled in 1998, at the medical school's centennial celebration. "I got goosebumps as I entered, looked around the empty room, and imagined what it would be like to attend this extraordinary institution. After a few minutes at the doorway, a guard came and politely told me to leave, since my dirty boots were soiling the floor. I looked at him and said proudly that I would be attending this institution a year from now. He laughed and said, 'Right, kid, and next year I am going to be Police
Commissioner.' "



Fauci graduated first in his class from Cornell in 1966, just as America's involvement in Vietnam was accelerating. Every new physician was required to perform some kind of military service. "We were gathered in the auditorium at Cornell, early in our fourth year of medical school," Fauci recalled. "Unlike today, we had only two women in the class and seventy-nine men. The recruiter from the armed forces came there and said, 'Believe it or not, when you graduate from medical school at the end of the year, except for the two women, everyone in this room is going to be either in the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, or the Public Health Service. So you're going to have to make your choice. Sign up and give your preferences.' "
Fauci wanted to work in the U.S. Public Health Service; his fallback was the Navy. He got his first choice, and ended up at the National Institutes of Health, which was then establishing itself as the country's primary center for biomedical research. Nearly everyone in academic medicine spent some time at one of its branches; except for three years back at Cornell to complete his internship and residency, Fauci has spent five decades there.
In 1972, Fauci started as a senior researcher at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He was drawn to investigating ailments that were difficult but not impossible to treat. "I wanted something that could make you very sick and kill you unless I intervened. And if I

intervene, you're essentially cured," he told Ushma Neill, the editor of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, in 2014. "Now, that seems a little bit too simplistic, but that's really the nature of most infectious diseases."
Working in the lab of Sheldon Wolff, Fauci studied the molecular nature
of fever. The field of immunology was still young, but scientists were rapidly learning how to manipulate the smallest components of individual cells, which opened the way to a decade of discovery.
Chronic fevers can have a number of underlying causes, among them an uncommon  condition known  as vasculitis-an inflammation  of the  blood cells that often occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own blood vessels. Many of Fauci's vasculitis patients suffered from rare inflammatory diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis , which damages blood vessels in the lungs, kidneys , and other organs. The disease was almost always fatal. Fauci and his infectious-disease colleagues at the N.I.H. were frequently asked to visit the National Cancer Institute, which was in the same building as his lab, to consult on patients who were receiving
chemotherapy. The drugs suppressed tumors, but they were highly toxic. And they had another side effect, Fauci told me: "Those people are susceptible to a lot of things like infections and bleeding, because the treatment has destroyed their immune systems."

Fauci, together with Wolff, his mentor, wondered if this side effect
could be harnessed to help vasculitis patients, whose immune systems were overactive. "I thought if we could somehow give a cancer drug at a low enough dose perhaps we could turn the disease off without any of the secondary co1nplications ," he recalled recently. "First we did it in a few patients, and, much to our delight, they had a total remission. Before you know it, we ended up curing a very, very lethal, albeit uncommon, disease."
For the first time, this technique enabled researchers to do effective
work on lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection. "If you look at inununology, it has fro1n the very beginning been inextricably linked to infectious diseases,"Fauci said. "Wh at is the immune syste1n for? The immune syste1n protects you against invaders from without­ microorganisms-as well as, in some cases, the emergence of certain tumors from within."



In 1981, a strange new syndrome emerged that transformed Fauci's research and, eventually, the lives of millions of people around the

world. "All of a sudden, this new disease comes along," Fauci recalled, referring to what would soon come to be known as AIDS. "Even before the cause of it was proven to be H.I.V., everybody in the field knew that it had to be a virus. I said to myself , 'Here it is, a virus, still to be determined, that's affecting profoundly and destroying the human immune system.' " Fauci believed that he had been training all his life for a threat like this one. He was an expert in viruses and in the immune system-and he had always been attracted to combatting serious, even fatal diseases. "I wanted to be where the action was," he said.
At first, few public-health officials seemed to care. In June of 1981,
the Morbidity and Mortality  Weekly Report, a publication of the Centers for Disease Control, issued a paper that included an account of five young men, all gay, who had contracted pneumocystis, a form of pneumonia that had previously been reported only in people with dramatically impaired immune systems. The young men described in the study had all been healthy. "I thought it was a fluke," Fauci recalled. "I put it aside on my desk, thinking that maybe this was some drug that they had taken that suppressed their immune system."
A month later, an even more alarming report arrived from the C.D.C. Fauci read it with an uneasy sense that a disaster was looming: "I made the decision that I was going to stop what I was doing, much to the chagrin of my mentors , who were saying, 'Why do you want to give up a great trajectory of a career to study a handful of gay men with this strange disease?' But, deep down, I really knew that this was going to explode."
Fauci wrote a paper to sound the alarm. "I called it my apologia pro vita sua-an explanation for what I'm doing," he said. In the paper, Fauci pointed out that, although the disease "seems to selectively affect a particular segment of our society," it demanded a medical solution. Moreover, he warned, "any assumption that the syndrome will remain restricted to a particular segment of our society is truly an assumption without a scientific basis." Fauci sent the manuscript to The New England Journal of Medicine, in late 1981. It was rejected. "One of the reviewers said I was being alarmist," Fauci said. He tried a different

journal , The Annals of Internal Medicine, and the following June the paper was published.
In the laboratory, Fauci began making progress. He had been investigating B cells, which are involved in the production of antibodies. In  1983-before H.I.V. was even known by that name-his  lab became the first to report that B cells became hyperactive in patients with AIDS. When a healthy person is invaded by a virus, antibodies mount a defense, but, when H.l.V. hijacked B cells, the antibody system went awry. Fauci and his team had identified one of the crucial features
of AIDS. "We made that observation without having any idea of what we
were dealing with," he said in an interview for an N.l.H. oral history. "I think that speaks for sound scientific and clinical observation." The politics of seeking a cure, though, would be far harder to manage.



On October 11, 1988, more than a thousand AIDS activists gathered outside the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration , in Rockville, Maryland, to protest the agency's glacial reaction to the epidemic. The activists knew that their community needed new treatments if they were to avoid catastrophe-but they were stymied by the F.D.A. 's drug-approval process , a remarkably inflexible system that typically took years.
That same day, another group of protesters marched onto the campus of
the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland. They were headed for Building 31, the home of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute 's director in 1984, was now the government's leading scientist focussed on
the AIDS epidemic. Even though he was not running the F.D.A., he appeared almost daily in the media to discuss the crisis. "My face was the face of the federal government," Fauci told me. He was asked the same question nearly every day: why wasn't the government moving faster? It didn't help that the Reagan Administration seemed so indifferent to the plague.
Fauci watched from his office window as activists surrounded the building and tried to scale its walls. Some were dressed in black robes

and carried scythes. Many waved pink-and-black banners, bearing the words "NIH Wake Up!" or "Stop Killing Us!" All over campus, a chant could be heard: "Fuck you, Fauci!"
"God, I hated him," Larry Kramer , the writer and activist who helped establish the two most important AIDS advocacy groups in the country, the Gay Men's Health Crisis and ACT UP, said. "As far as I was concerned, he was the central focus of evil in the world." Kramer attacked Fauci relentlessly in the media. He called him an "incompetent idiot" and a "pill-pushing" tool of the medical establishment, insulted his wife, and even compared him to Adolf Eichmann. In 1988, Kramer published a scathing open letter. "Anthony Fauci, you are a murderer," he wrote. "Your refusal to hear the screams of AIDS activists early in the crisis resulted in the deaths of thousands of Queers."
As the epidemic spread and the death toll rose, it was common for gay
activists to view Fauci and NIAID with rage. Fauci did not control the drug-approval process, but he was seen as a barrier to opening access to clinical trials, in which volunteers could receive potentially lifesaving medications.
For most people infected with H.I.V., taking experimental drugs was the only alternative to simply waiting for death. Yet the F.D.A.'s arcane rules prevented the vast majority of patients from qualifying for trials. For instance, a significant number of H.I.V. patients suffered from pneumocystis pneumonia. The condition-the same one observed in the initial C.D.C. report-could be fatal, so many who had it used an experimental antimicrobial medication called pentamidine, which had proved highly effective. But people who took experimental medications were barred from participating in other clinical trials.
At first, Fauci held to the standard N.I.H. line that research need not focus on the immediate welfare of patients. "When we had clinical trials, we, the scientific community and the regulatory co1nmunity, did not listen" to the activists, he recalled. "It was, at the time, an attitude that many of us had, and I probably had it myself." He was right about that. I covered the AIDS epidemic for the Washington Post , and it was clear to me that Fauci was inclined to enforce the paternalistic medical tradition in which he had trained: doctors and scientists were unquestioned

authorities, and drug development had to follow a rigid process that included animal testing and rigorous clinical trials. Otherwise, the benefits and the risks of these drugs could not be adequately assessed. In 1987, the F.D.A. approved the first drug to treat H.I.V.­ azidothymidine,  or AZT-and the announcement was met with a burst of hope. But the drug's liabilities were evident almost instantly. It had
harsh side effects, and the benefits wore off; the virus itself soon became
resistant to the drug. When new clinical studies began, involving cocktails of AZT and similar compounds, tens of thousands of people asked to participate. Again, though, volunteers were not accepted if they used other experitnental drugs. The anger among activists grew inore intense. "They started becoming amazingly iconoclastic and confrontational, and that scared the hell out of the scientists, who were fundamentally quite conservative ," Fauci told me at his medical-school reunion. "When they were demonstrating on the N.I.H. campus, disrupting Wall Street, disrupting St. Patrick's Cathedral, instead of listening to them, scientists withdrew."
Without entirely understanding his own motives, Fauci decided to look
beyond the activists' furious rhetoric and style. He recalls telling
himself , "Let me put aside the goth dress-the earrings and the Mohawk haircuts and the black jackets-and just listen to what they have to say. And what they were saying made absolutely perfect sense." It helped that Fauci had something in common with the activists: "They were all New York guys. I had a little affinity to them because I'm a New
Yorker. And I said, What would I do if I were in their shoes? And it was
very clear: I would have done exactly the same thing."
The activists knew that they were facing a mercilessly lethal disease. In the summer of 1985, I travelled to New York to write my first long story on the toll that the epidemic was taking on the city's gay community. I interviewed dozens of men. To the best of my knowledge, only two of them are still alive: Larry Kramer, who is now eighty-four, and a political activist who prefers to remain anonymous.
Fauci, too, came to understand the severity of the crisis. "Everyone
died," he said. "I was used to treating people who had little hope and then saving their lives-that was so wonderful. But, with AIDS in those

days, Isaved no one. It was the darkest time of my life." Faced with mounting evidence that his cautious approach made no sense, he did something that few public officials do: he reversed himself. Fauci transformed from a conventional bench scientist into a public-health activist who happened to work for the federal government. "I had to change," he told me.



When the demonstrators marched on the N.I.H. campus in 1988, Fauci no longer saw a threat. "I looked at them, and I saw people who were in pain," he recalled in an article in Holy Cross Magazine. He asked the police and the F.B.I. not to arrest any of the1n. Then he invited a handful of protest leaders to his office. "That began a relationship over many years," Fauci said. "They let me into their camp.Iwent to the gay bathhouses and spoke to them.Iwent to San Francisco, to the Castro District, and Idiscussed the problems they were having, the degree of suffering that was going on in the community, the need for them to get involved in clinical trials, since there were no other possibilities for them to get access to drugs. AndIearned their confidence."
Fauci, in his mid-forties, was the youngest director of an N.I.H. institute in a century, and he lacked the political influence to act independently. Even in his own field, he struggled to recruit allies. "I couldn't convince my own people in infectious-disease leadership to take on H.I.V./AIDS," he told me. So he created a division within his institute devoted to the disease.
One day, in the late eighties, Fauci asked me to stop by his office in Building 31 on the N.I.H. campus. He told me that he had a wild idea: he wanted to hire Mark Harrington, ACT UP's point man on drug-treatment trials. Harrington, a prominent AIDS researcher and activist, had no formal scientific training. But Fauci, like most of those who had seen
him testify before Congress or speak to a crowd, was dazzled by his
brilliance.
Harrington discussed the idea with Fauci, but decided that the job would be a disaster for him. "There's no wayIcould have functioned within    that bureaucracy ," he told me recently. "The people Irespect would have

seen me as a sellout." Yet Harrington continued to make a profound impression on Fauci's thinking.
Harrington was passionately committed to loosening up the F.D.A. 's restrictive regime. "It was murder," he told me. "I don't know any other way to describe it." Harrington, who went on to win a MacArthur "genius" grant for his work on the disease, established himself as the most knowledgeable student of the agency 's byzantine regulations. In meetings with Fauci and other officials, he urged them to move faster and with greater compassion for those who were suffering.
There are three stages in most F.D.A. clinical trials . The first tests
whether a drug is safe. The second assesses its efficacy. The last stage, conducted in larger groups, confirms that the drug works and that there are no serious adverse reactions. Harrington argued that people with no alternativ e should be granted access to those drugs as soon as they had been proved safe, even if their effectiveness remained unknown.
At first, Fauci was concerned that, if people taking multiple experimental medications joined clinical trials, the results would be hopelessly muddled. He was also afraid that granting sick people unrestricted access to unapproved drugs would deter them from participating in the trials at all. Harrington and other activists reassured
him that they were committed to strictly monitored drug trials that would
provide enough data to know what worked and what did not.
Fauci is a realist, and the facts were obvious to anyone who cared to look. Traditional methods of testing drugs weren't working.
Underground networks were growing everywhere. With so
many AIDS patients taking untested medications , federal health officials had to concede that their system was broken. Even the most fundamental protocol of a clinical trial-giving some participants a placebo-came into question. Ina study conducted in San Francisco in 1989, nearly all the volunteers had their medicine analyzed, to see whether they were receiving an active dose. Those who learned that they had been given placebos almost invariably dropped out.
"There was a feeling in science that doctors know best, scientists know
best," Fauci said. "We love our patients, but they don't really know
what's best for them. Then, when we dealt with this disease that was

brand new-that was frightening, that was killing people in a way that was historic-the people who were impacted by the disease wanted to have something to say about how we conducted research."
There were still moments of confrontation. In May, 1990, hundreds
of ACT UP activists returned to the N.I.H., demanding
more AIDS treatments and greater representation of women and people of color in clinical trials. At a planning session for the protest, a young activist named Tony Malliaris performed a rap song called "Storm the NIH," which included the lyrics "I don't know what Fauci thinks, but
this ain't Denmark, and something stinks." (Malliaris died five years later, still in his early thirties.)
Fauci was undeterred. He threw his influence behind a program called Parallel Track, which made unapproved AIDS drugs available as soon as they were demonstrated to be safe, even as clinical trials were continuing. The initiative would not have succeeded without Fauci. But he always acknowledged that his approach had been shaped largely by the constructive pressure he received from AIDS advocacy groups and from leaders like Harrington.
This more inclusive approach ushered in a revolution in American medicine. Patients today demand as much information as possible about treatments they might receive, and no longer act as if their doctors' advice came straight from Mt. Olympus. They scour the Internet, assemble statistics, and often arrive at the hospital with a folder full of medical information. The F.D.A., for its part, will no longer consider approving a new drug until it has consulted representatives of groups who would use it. "There are strict scientific principles that have to be adhered to in medicine," Fauci told me. "At the same time, a humanistic touch is needed in dealing with people. You have to combine social aspects, ethical aspects, personal aspects with cold, clean science."

In 2002, I wrote a Profile of Larry Kramer for this magazine. By then, he and Fauci had become friends, with each expressing gratitude for the other's work in those years. Fauci told me, "In American medicine, there are two eras: before Larry and after Larry. There is no question in my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. When all the

screaming and the histrionics are forgotten, that will remain." Kramer, who spent years in a constant rage at Fauci, now calls him "the only true and great hero" among government officials in the AIDS crisis.



As Trump defends his Administration's response to the pandemic, he has suggested repeatedly that COVID-19 was impossible to predict. "There's never been anything like this in history," he said, at a press
conference on March 19th. "Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or
epidemic of this proportion."
As everyone with even a casual interest in the history of science knows, pandemics have altered the destiny of humanity at least since 430 B.C., when Athens was struck by a plague that killed as many as two-thirds of its residents, just as the Spartans were laying siege. Beginning in 165
A.D., smallpox helped ruin the Roman Empire, sowing more destruction
than foreign armies ever could. And, in the fourteenth century, the Black Death swept through Europe , killing more than half the population, according to recent estimates.
Yet, by the middle of the twentieth century, many scientists had begun to conceive of a world that was largely free of infectious epidemics. In 1951, Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, a future Nobel laureate in medicine, wrote, "The fever hospitals are vanishing or being turned to other uses.
With full use of the knowledge we already possess, the effective control
of every important infectious disease"-with the exception of polio-"is possible. " His optimism was understandable. Antibiotics had made
many lethal diseases easy to treat; improvements in sanitary conditions
had transformed the lives of hundreds of millions of people. In developed countries, typhoid, cholera, and measles-major killers throughout history-had largely passed into memory; even tuberculosis , one of the great scourges of humanity, had been in decline for nearly
half a century. By 1972, Macfarlane, writing with the microbiologist David White, was predicting that the "most likely forecast about the future of infectious diseases is that it will be very dull."
When Fauci was a young trainee, these kinds of predictions sometimes
made him wonder if he had picked the wrong career. "I became

concerned that I was entering ...an area of biomedical research that was disappearing," he recalled in one speech. But, since 1984, when Fauci became the director ofNIAID, there has not been a single day in which some epidemic has not threatened the globe. According to the World Health Organization, AIDS has killed more than thirty million
people, and nearly forty million are now living with H.I.V. Tuberculosis, far from sliding into obscurity, infects roughly a quarter of the human population; the W.H.O. says that one and a half million people died from the disease in 2018.
But the greatest threat that humanity faces, by far, is a global outbreak of
a lethal virus for which no treatment has been found. In just a few months, COVID-19 has forced billions of people, in nearly every country on earth, into a panicked withdrawal from society. Another pandemic like this might appear in two years, or in ten, or in a century. But I have never met a virologist or an epidemiologist who believes we won't encounter one.
For a deadly virus to flourish, it must meet three critical conditions.
First, a new  virus-one  to which no one has yet developed  immunity­ must emerge from the animal reservoirs that produce and harbor such pathogens. Second, the virus has to make humans sick. (The vast majority do not.) Finally, it must be able to spread efficiently, through coughing, sneezing, or shaking hands. That combination is rare , but, when it appears, the consequences are almost always disastrous.
The Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg, who
died in 2008, was for years the world's most visionary voice about emerging infectious diseases. "Some people think I am being hysterical, but there are catastrophes ahead," he once wrote. "We live in evolutionary  competition with microbes-bacteria and viruses. There is no guarantee that we will be the survivors."
In 2003, Lederberg joined the future F.D.A. commissioner Margaret
Hamburg and the pandemic specialist Mark Smolinski to edit a seminal report, in which prominent scientists argued for a much more aggressive defense of the planet. Titled "Microbial Threats to Health," the report recommended that the U.S. greatly expand its early-warning systems, particularly in the developing world. It also urged leaders to strengthen

their ability to respond to microbial threats, with new efforts on the federal, state, and local levels. The recommendations were almost completely ignored.
The next year, a highly pathogenic form of avian influenza, H5Nl,
leaped from waterfowl to chickens and then to humans. Public-health officials were petrified. In Bangkok , I met with Scott Dowell, who led the Thailand office of the C.D.C.'s International Emerging Infections Program. "The world just has no idea what it's going to see if this thing comes," he told me. He paused and then reframed his thought. "When, really. It's when. I don't think we can afford the luxury of the word 'if anymore."
In a sense, the world was lucky with H5Nl. Although the U.S . and other
countries mounted a diffident response , the virus turned out to be deadly but not very contagious. Five years later, the situation was reversed. A new influenza virus, designated HlNl , infected nearly a quarter of the global population before vaccines became widely available. This time, the virus was highly contagious but not nearly as deadly as most strains of influenza. The fact that the outbreak was less virulent than public­ health officials had feared created its own danger; by encouraging complacency , it did more to expose the world to the risk of a devastating new pandemic than anything else that had happened in decades. Although Congress had appropriated money to stockpile antiviral medications and protective gear, many scientists felt that the effort was grossly insufficient. "We spend many billions of dollars every year on missile-defense  systems," Seth Berkley, a medical epidemiologist who leads the Global Vaccine Alliance, told me. "And yet we will not spend pennies on the dollar to prepare for a catastrophe that is far more likely to affect us all."
After the Ebola outbreak of 2014, Barack Obama implemented one of
Lederberg 's central reco1nmendations: he established the White House 's National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense , an early-warning system for disease in the developing
world. Trump disbanded it in 2018, as part of an effort to streamline the
N.S.C. In an appearance before Congress, Fauci was asked if the decision was a mistake. He responded diplomatically: "I wouldn 't

necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there."



The combination of money and political will can have extraordinary effects on public health. Under the George W. Bush Administration, Fauci was the principal architect of a landmark program called PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
By the time Bush took office, therapies for H.I.V. had become widely
available in Western countries. But, for millions of people in the developing world, these drugs were too expensive or too difficult to obtain. Bush felt that it was unacceptable for the poorest people on earth to die because they could not afford medication that was dispensed routinely in the rich world. He asked Fauci to implement an initiative to prevent and treat H.I.V. on a global scale. It has been uniformly held up as a model of the ways in which global public-health programs can save lives. "PEPFAR has turned around declining life expectancies in many countries and likely saved some countries-even an entire continent­ from economic ruin,"Harold Varmus, a former director of the N.I.H. and of the National Cancer Institute, wrote in the quarterly
journal Science & Diplomacy.
But Fauci has at times struggled to compel politicians and businesses to attack the problems that he considers most worrisome. Over the years, he has become concerned about the possible impact of new viruses, particularly a lethal strain of influenza. Other viruses are more consistently deadly; some, like measles, are more contagious. But no virus that we know of is capable of killing as rapidly and as efficiently. "We need a major paradigm shift with influenza vaccines," Fauci told me, four years ago. "The situation is a mess."
Because the flu virus evolves so rapidly, experts deciding how to
formulate vaccines can make only a highly educated guess about which strains are most likely to make people sick. Each February, epidemiologists study outbreaks around the world-especially in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is under way-to assess which strains might make their way north. The result is always better than

nothing. In many years, though , it is woefully inadequate. In the flu season of 2014-15, the vaccine protected less than a fifth of the people who received it. In 2017-18, it worked for a little more than a third. Fauci has long supported the development of an alternative: a universal influenza vaccine, which would provide lasting defense against all strains. "Similar to tetanus, a universal flu vaccine probably would be given every ten years," he said. "And, if you get one that is really universal, you can vaccinate just about everyone in the world." But such a vaccine would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and
test-and would replace a product that most consumers already think of
as good enough. No one has come close to raising the money that such a project will require.



By the beginning of the new millennium, it had become clear that the next microbial threat might not come from a bat or a duck. It could just as well be created by a human being. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, anonymous letters laced with deadly anthrax spores began arriving at media companies and congressional offices. In the following months, twenty-two people were infected by inhaling anthrax and five died. Suddenly, biological terror posed an entirely new threat­ one that has become only more significant and complex in the ensuing years. In 2016, James Clapper, who was the director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration , listed gene editing as a potential weapon of mass destruction. Many scientists were furious, but he had a point. Researchers have deployed these tools to rewrite the genes of mosquitoes so that they are unable to transmit malaria. If their success in the lab translates to the field, it will be a historic triumph. But the research also raises an alarming possibility: if a scientist can modify the genes of an insect to protect people from malaria, he could almost certainly use the same technology to add a deadly toxin.
Fauci often cites a similar but more immediate paradox. Thanks to
genetic engineering, we are more equipped than ever to respond to the threat of a viral pandemic. After the COVID-19 outbreak began, it took scientists less than a month to sequence the genome of the virus. By the

end of February, the instructions were on the Internet, and the virus had been re-created in laboratories around the world, by scientists seeking to develop drugs and vaccines.
And yet, despite our mastery of molecular biology, we live in an era in
which someone can wake up with an infection in China-or France, Australia, or any other place with an airport-and fly to San Francisco in time for dinner, spreading the virus long before he suspects that there's anything wrong. For most of human history, a virus like COVID-19 might have killed many people in the community where it originated, but then stopped spreading. According to a comprehensive analysis carried out
by the Times, at least four hundred and thirty thousand people have
arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China since the outbreak began. Forty thousand have arrived in the two months since Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China trying to enter the country.
Fauci insists that an adequate defense against future pandemics will have
to be flexible. "I have been saying for eight, ten years that we should make a list of microbes and try to develop a basic platform vaccine," he told me in 2016. A platform vaccine addresses an entire class of virus, not just a particular strain. "We keep trying to develop a vaccine for one thing-usually the last one-and it's a waste of time," he said. "Every time we get hit, it is always something we didn't expect. So, instead of predetermining what it is you're going to prepare for, make universal platforms."
Such an approach is eminently possible. Using gene-sequence
information and synthetic DNA, biologists are now capable of making parts of a vaccine in advance. It takes almost no time to sequence a viral strain, and with that information it should be possible to complete a bespoke vaccine in a matter of weeks. "You could build a chassis for the vaccine, and you would have it on the shelf," Fauci said. "Then all you would need to do is insert the gene of the protein you want to express and make a gazillion doses and send it out."
There are even more futuristic aspirations: the genomics pioneer J. Craig
Venter has proposed using a sort of 3-D printer to manufacture vaccines on demand. It is already possible to print the nucleotides that make up DNA and assemble them. Venter argues that, in the time it takes for an

infected person to fly from one side of the world to the other, we should be able to print, assemble, and administer a vaccine.
To even contemplate creating these kinds of treatments, Fauci says, would require building an entirely new system for making vaccines before a pandemic arises. But, in addition to the scientific obstacles, this would cost billions of dollars, and no company or politician has been willing to spend the money. Perhaps, just as AIDS transformed our approach to clinical trials, our experience with COVID-19 will change our attitudes about preventing infectious diseases. A proper investment in both research and emergency preparedness would have prevented at
least some of the unspeakable human loss we are now experiencing and
the economic crash that has just begun.
The COVID-19 epidemic will eventually fade, but the public will demand a reckoning. Inevitably, there will be an investigation, along the lines of the 9/11 Commission, to look into the ramifications of the President's denialism, the shortages in testing and medical equipment, and the dismissal of so many warning signs. Fauci will not necessarily escape criticism. He is an excellent spokesman for the value of scientific research, but he runs a single institute, and he lacks the authority to broadly reshape our response to pandemics. "The kinds of things we really desperately need as foundational tools for dealing with this stuff aren't necessarily research enterprises," Harold Varmus told me. "Tony isn't running C.D.C. He's not running FEMA. To tell him to stockpile defense mechanisms or to move forward surveillance tools into massive operations around the world-that's just not his remit. "
Even Fauci' s current value as a scientific adviser has been limited by the
President's contempt for expertise. Trump's coronavirus kitchen cabinet consists of people like his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has no medical knowledge  or experience managing crises-yet has been appointed to direct the response to the biggest medical emergency since the influenza pandemic of 1918. Trump has also turned for advice to Dr. Mehmet Oz, who for years has endorsed worthless treatments and used his television show to promote notorious quacks. Trump even seems to think that his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, should debate Fauci about the value of specific drugs. When Navarro, who has a doctoral degree in

economics , was asked about his medical qualifications , he said, "I have a Ph.D. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it's in medicine, the law, economics , or whatever."
Among Navarro 's enthusiasms is the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine,
which he believes could cure COVID-19. There is currently no evidence
to support this conclusion, as Fauci has pointed out on several occasions . On April 5th, as Trump continued to tout the drug as a miracle cure, a reporter at the daily briefing asked Fauci to comment. Trump refused to allow him to speak. In an appearance two days later, Trump kept up the hype. "I say try it," he said. "You're not gonna die from this pill." Not long afterward, he even suggested that zinc might help.
To plan a coherent biological future, rather than simply scramble to
contain each new pandemic , will require an entirely new kind of political commitment. It would certainly include the creation of a permanent position, a special assistant to the President for biological defense. Similar jobs have existed in the past, but not for long, and not with enough influence to matter. David Relman, the Stanford professor, told me, "This kind of job needs somebody w ith the authority to preside over domestic and international threats , both natural and deliberate. And that person has to sit in the White Hou se with immediate access to the President. Without that, we will really have nothing that can work." Until then, we have Fauci, a seventy-nine-year-old infectious -disease expert pinned between Donald Trump and the American people. It can't be easy. As Fauci recently put it, with characteristic candor, "I give the appearance of being optimistic. But, deep down, I ju st do everything I possibly can, assuming that the worst will happen, and I've got to stop
the worst from happening." +

WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)-ln what he described as a "potentially major breakthrough," Dr. Anthony Fauci has convinced Donald Trump to attack COV/0-19 as if it were an inspector general. Fauci,who has been frustrated in his efforts to get through to Trump, compared the global pandemic to an inspector general while in a closed-door meeting with the President on Wednesday.
"What do you hate more than anything, Mr. President?" Fauci asked .
"Jim Acosta," Trump immediately replied.
"O.K., fine. But, besides Jim Acosta," Fauci said, "it would be an inspector general, right?" "You're right, Tony," Trump agreed. "I hate those losers."
"Well, think of COVID-19 as the worst inspector general in the world," Fauci continued . "It's overseeing
everything you do and making you follow the law. It's keeping you from spending taxpayer money on
anything you want. You wouldn't stand for that,would you?"
Reportedly, Trump appeared shaken by Fauci's analogy. "Damn it,Tony,when you put it that way, we've got to do something about COV/0-19," he said .
Speaking to reporters, Fauci said that he was "cautiously optimistic" that his inspector-genera lanalogy would finally spur Trump to action, but added, "Jared could still screw this up."

Hello Dr. Anthony Fauci,


I'm Alessandro Matarante, an italian reporter, currently working for Mediaset, Italy's most important television broadcast. Specifically, I work for Quarta Repubblica, a program aired every Monday in prime-time, leaded by reporter Nicola Porro.
I'm writing this e-mail because it would be a pleasure and an honor for us to interview you about the coronavirus emergency and the way the United States are facing it.
Clearly, we are available to consider any kind of day and hour to make the interview, and so we are to consider together the contents of the interview.

Hoping for a positive answer,
Iwish you a pleasant day.

Dear Tony:


I am sorry to bother you with another request during this period. The Italian Embassy is organizing its yearly Research Day (Giornata della Ricerca) that this year will be held strictly online (via Zoom or other e-meeting tool) and centered entirely on the Coronavirus pandemic .

The Italian Ambassador, Mr. Varricchio, would be delighted if you accept to be his guest of honor at the event and asked me to informally enqui re with you, before sending an official invitation, if there is any chance you could participate. He understands how crazy your schedule is during this crisis. They would like you to deliver a 30 min lecture on a theme of your choice, preferably related to the state of the art of the pandemic management. The
tentative date for the event is between April 20 and April 30, but they are waiting to
finalize the date based on your preference, if you are able to accept (even in early May).


Please, let me know if you can accommodate this additional engagement. You will make them very very happy!

All the best,


Paolo

For my syndicated colwnn, f want to do a piece on the racial aspect of coronavirus. I'm not seeing any breakdown
of deaths in the poorer areas as opposed to !he more prosperous ones.

Jsn't that the telling statistic here that the economically less well off live in areas where medical services are inadequate and as a result they have more underlying conditions that make theM more vulnerable ? Isn 't it relevant that people of color are predominantly among the poorer in our country for a variety of reasons?

lwill appreciate your comments, particularly since you have so little to do these days.

statement and said it most likely would be influenza, but I was concerned with any type of novel respiratory virus that efficiently spread from human to human and that bad a high degree of morbidity and mortality

2.)  Dyker Heights versus Bensonhurst:

 What do we say about where he grew up.? He always says Bensonhurst. The
apartment was technically in Dyker Heights, though the neighborhood lines shift. And I never see him mention moving neighborhoods. Did he move? Yes. I moved. I was born at                       CbH6>.n the middle of the Bensonhurst section
of Brooklyn. When I was 9 years old my father opened a Pharmacy on 8302-13th Avenue at the outer edge of the Dyker Heights Section of Brooklyn (ouJy We moved into an apartment over the pharmacy .


     3.) [ the question below is the meaning of hyperactive. Does it mean producing too many B cells or that they were too active, as in working too hard, producing too many antibodies??] Not necessarily too many B cells. It means that the B cells that are there, are aberrantly turned on

      He had been investigating B-cells, which are involved in the production of antibodies. In 1983-before H.l .V. was even known by that name-his lab became the first to report that B-cells became hyperactive in patients with AIDS . The virus was somehow leading its hosts to overproduce a defense that normally would keep them healthy. Fauci had identified one of the crucial features of AIDS. "We made that observation without having any idea of what we were dealing with," he said. "l think that speaks for sound scientific and clinical observation." The pol itics of seeking a cure, though, would be far harder to manage.



 4.).    This I asked before you could not speak to me but we can take me out of it. Or do whatever you like: I asked Fauci if he thought that novel coronavirus wou ld force a change in attitude among_political leaders and funding agencies .           (b)




 5.).	This you l1ave said in more than one place. People kind of becam.e alarmed when you were absent so just  want to be sure you don't mind it in here:  No problem.

      Fauci said that there was nothing meaningful about his absence from the Mar.23 White House briefing , "I was tied up in a task force meeting, and we were trying to work out some difficult pol icies and the topic of the briefing that day was more related to otbe1· members of the Task Force. He also said, "I have no trouble with the President. When I talk to him, he listens. ''

Hello Eliseo and Courtney,


During the White House briefing on COVID-19 this evening, there was a discussion on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on African Americans, health disparities and data collection. Please see CSPAN Clips below Icued up.

Iknow we are not commenting but Iwould like to recommend that we have some talking points prepared and on hold in case we receive congressional inquiries. These topics are also receiving coverage on the networks.

Thank you,

Iwant to share an important update about Lilly's efforts to address insulin affordability. In response to the crisis caused by COVID-19, Lilly is introducing the Lilly Insulin Value Program, allowing anyone with commercia l insurance - and those without insurance - to fill their monthly prescription of Lilly insulin for $35. The program is effective today and

covers most Lilly insulins. Details and more information can be found in the press release here attached.

Lilly has introduced several solutions in recent years to help meet the individual financial circumstances of people living with diabetes that are still in effect during the COVID-19 crisis, including:
 The Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, through which representatives can direct people to the $35 savings card, as well as affordability options that may reduce their out-of-pocket costs further -such as free insulin for people with minimal income, or no income at all, that has been donated by Lilly to non-profit organizations.
 Three non-branded versions of our insulin options with list prices 50 percent lower than the branded versions.
 In January, the company announced plans to donate at least 200,000 KwikPens® to relief agencies over the next three years.

Hope all is well with you....

Dr . Fauci -


I'm a safety/secmity consultan t to independent and charter schools. Irun a firm suppm1ing
1,000 of them. What, if anything, would you want them to know? I'm wondering if there's
any chance in the world you'd be willing to join us and a few hundred schools for a 15 - 30- minute webinar one day next week?

Specifically, schools are looking for information/perspective as it relates to what to expect as we return to a new normal and the like. Beyond that, they've begun to ask questions such as what we can be thinking about for this short period of time between the- return to school and the development of a vaccine. What would best prac tice look like for us to educate, but maintain social distance? I believe we can manage a lot of the operationalizing but would be
immensely grateful for some high-level guidance to follow.

I recognize how incredibly busy this time is for you and would be so incredibly grateful for any
time you might be will ing to spare for this audience.


With immense gratitude,

Subject: NFLPA-NFL Task Force Hi Courtney,
  \ I hope you, your family and your loved ones are harboring safely through this storm.  2nd, thanks for your efforts and those of Dr. Fauci-he is truly a national treasure during this crisis and it is deeply appreciated.

Iappreciate your help and introductions on how our players can be helpful. As you know Drew and Brittany Brees made a $SM contribution to the Louisiana coronavirus efforts and they have done a lot of press.   Drew's message has been "Hang in there-hang tough I   We are in th is together."

I've done several webinars with our players and their families, both educating them and pointing out their role both with friends and family as well as on social media to let NFL fans know that whether or not we have an NFL season depends to a large extent upon those fans following the guidelines zealously-as zealously as they follow NFL games!

That message seems to be getting through.


Iwrite now with a request for a little bit of Dr. Fauci's time in about 2 weeks. Irequested that we stand up a joint NFLPA-NFL Task Force to scenario plan a pathway to getting NFL Club facilities open, with a view towards if and when we might look towards an NFL season, even if games are played with no fans. My request is to have Dr. Fauci give a telephone briefing to our group on this difficult topic, which would of course be confidential. The floor would be his and Ican brief him prior to the call on what we have been working on. If he were willing, we can do the call anytime, probably during the week of April 13, although of course the modeling shows that would be during the peak of the outbreak. We could also do it the week before or after.

Thanks so much for considering this. We are mindful of the psychological toll the virus is taking and the lift NFL games would give to a sports-starved population, but only if it can be done safely for the players and the fans who (ultimately) allow them to play this great game.

Again, thanks! Best,
Doc

Subject: Hello

Dr. Glass,




,..(.b.'")""c  >

Ihope you are well and Iwanted to check in to see how you are doing in this scary and traumatic time for our wor ld.

During these times, I'm especially thankful for the training I received from the Fogarty Institute. Iremember your wise words at our Fogarty orientation in 2011- on why investing in Global health is so critical. No truer words have been spoken especially at times like these!

I'm currently communicating  with my former colleagues in Zambia (Mpanji and Innocent pictured here with
me   https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/behindthebench/using-sanger-sequencing-to­ detect-drug-resistance-mutations-in-hiv-in-zambia/) from CIDRZ to see how testing can be brought up via the public health infrastructure in place currently. Thankfully, the number of cases is very low, although the unreported cases are much higher than likely captured
(https://www . arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index   .html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b4 8e9ecf6 ) . My friend who is a Lieutenant Physician actually likely contracted COVID-19 in January and wrote that she and others
had treated a patient returning from Wuhan who was pregnant of
respiratory illness upon coming back to Lusaka to deliver, only to die of pleural effusion later. They subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and resolved, but these are the types of cases that likely go undetected and can potentially contribute to community spread of the disease.

Thank you again for being such a wonderful role model, and Ilook to leaders like you and Dr. Fauci to help our nation think with prudent but difficult decisions.

Kind regards, Lillian

RE: It's Fred upton



Fred:
  Thanks for the note.  The answer is almost certainly yes, but there would not be enough of them whereby we can compare the results inthose who were receiving Hydroxychloroquine or not for their lupus.  Large natural history studies, which we will be initiating could possibly answer that question.

We're looking for data elements to collect and wonder if your teams could give us some insight from a public health perspective. Iam copying Amy to see if she has anything else to add. Perhaps you could assign someone to work with Amy. Thanks

Thank you for all that you a re doing in the fight aga inst COVID-19. Your steady leadersh ip and grounding in the science,a nd your ability to communicate complex information clear ly to policymakers and the public, are what the wor ld needs during this crisis. I know we will see the other side of this pandemic, and you will have once again saved many lives with your work.

Iam one step removed from this response, as Iam on a detail assignment from FEMA to the Naval Academy ,but have been sha ring information with the Superintendent and his senior leadership team so that they can make good decisions to protect the community while meeting the Academy's mission. I have thought back to the H1N1 response in 2009-2010 many times since this began.

Aga in, thank you for what you're doing. My best wishes to you and your family.

Subject: ASF : daily data call from Sec Ofc



Per request from the Secretary's office that Isent you this morning, below is what I propose to submit tomorrow morning for the new daily 9am data call. I will plan to submit pretty much the same thing every day . Iwill not clog your in-box with it unless there is a significant update.






RFIfrom Staff Sec:

1. For tomorrow's press conference,what information or topics do you recommend be included in the President 's remarks? Please provide talking point-level details and support.

Nothing specific from NIAID at this time.

2. For tomorrow's press conference,on what information (if any) do you intend to speak?

Specific topics will depend on questions from reporters. Dr. Fauci has been asked about the effect of social distancing; considerations that would factor into returning the country to normal life; off-labe l use of treatments such as hydrochloroquine ;the status of clinical trials; and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color.

NIAID-specific talking points:

 NIAID has mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop effective countermeas ures for COV ID-19, including diagnostics, vaccines to prevent disease and treatments.


 NIAID is supporting a clinical trial of the antiviral remdesivir and is investigating other treatments , including antibody therapies and other antivirals, for their activity against SARS-CoV-2. Well-designed clinical trials are the best way to evaluate potential treatments for safety and efficacy.

 NIAID is supporting an early-stage clinical trial of an investigational vaccine called mRNA-1273, developed by NIAID scientists and the biotechnology company Moderna. The study launched first in Seattle, with a second site recently added in Atlanta .  NIAID is researching additional vaccine candidates.

 NIAID has launched a serosurvey study that aims to determine how many adults in the United States without a confirmed history of COVID-19 have antibodies to the virus. Researchers will collect and analyze blood samples from as many as 10,000 adult volunteers without a confirmed history of COVID-19. The results will help illuminate the extent to which the novel coronavirus has spread undetected in the United States and provide insights into which communities and populations are most affected. [NOTE:This serosurvey is for research purposes. It is not meant to be a way for people to access antibody testing for personal knowledge of prior infection history. If it is portrayed as a way for people to "get tested" to understand their own infection history, we can expect that people will inaccurately blame the government for not receiving results in a timely manner. People can request to learn about their results, which will be available only after weeks or months of analysis.]



 NIAID is expanding its portfolio of basic research on coronaviruses and emerging pathogens to characterize SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-
19) and understand how it causes disease. NIAID also is using animal models to better understand the infection and to investigate optimal ways to treat and prevent COVID-19.

3.	Are there topics or announcements for future press conferences (other

FYI - per request below, HHS is setting up a daily data call. We need to tell them at 9am what you are going to discuss at the daily press conference at the end of the day. My observation is that this may be hard to predict. However, we can certainly come up with some boilerplate talking points that we re-submit every day, emphasizing the importance of properly designed clinical trials as the best way to identify treatments.

Hi Courtney -

Ihope you're having a good weekend. Just wanted to touch base because starting tomorrow, we will be receiving requests for information from Staff Sec each evening ahead of the next day's press conference
- for a turnaround by 9am the following morning. Staff Sec is requesting feedback (see the questions
below) from task force experts, including Dr. Fauci, on information they recommend be included in the next day's press conference.


Could you please help me identify a primary POC at NIAID that Ican work with to get information to Staff Sec?

Sounds good, Dr, Fauci - we greatly appreciate the effort that you/Cliff and your team have put into this.

Look forwa rd to receiving and discussing the guidelines (no need for a separate meeting with me first - we can go straight to the Secretary) and agree that they will not be subjected to additional layers of formal clearance given the circumstances .

Adding Judy to quickly help coordinate a time to meet with the Secretary. Thanks again,

Hi,Dr. Fauci.


Thank you so much for keeping things honest and know that I am such a champion of you.


I hope that reaching out is okay. I work at HHS/IOS team. As I sit here at home and have been thinking about the shortage of medical supplies, doggie cones actually can be used as protection for our health care workers. Just a thought that looks and sounds crazy but can help.

Dear Dr. Fauci ,

J was in touch with	(b) (6) back in January and he said you all were underwater there with coronavirus. I
can only imagine how mucb busier you are now, with COVID-19 taking hold across America.

We (myself, husband, and family) have followed the news since the start. ln watching,Iwas reminded of the old
sign we had posted on the printer between	(b) (   and my desk for quite some time that read , "Keep Cahn and Trnst Fauci". J can't recall whether we put that up during the Ebola outbreak or Zika, but never has it been more true. We never cease to be amazed at h.ow well you carry yourself, respond to politically loaded questions. and get the truth out in such a way that any viewer can understand.

You also never seem to frustrate from answering the same questions which 1am sure must get old. There has been one question l have yet to hear asked however. Who is cutting your hair? Iknow you used to have a regular gal but with social distancing, we are speculating that perhaps there is a Wl1ite House barber you use. Of course we know how busy you are so don't expect a reply, just wanted to throw you a question you may not have had yet.Iam also wondering how your office tree is doing. How many bungee cords are supporting it these days?

We have found plenty of reasons to smile with the whole family gettLng in on what we're dubbing the ASF # I Fan Club. From 111e1m:s, to cartoons, lo l-shirt:;,we are all here supporting you and wishing for your contin ued hea]lh and success. I run attaching some of our shenanigans in hopes you get a kick out of it and to provide some comic relief.


You've been thanked over and over but J must sa   it too. Thank you, Dr. Fauci, for all that you do. And thank you to the staff behind the scenes that makes it haJlpen . (b) (    is no doubt just as busy a5< you as a.Iways CM, are you
reading th is email? Hi!). When we see you at all hours from the NIH studio and your office, T think of the media staff support you receive, and especiaJl · assistance from	(b) (   for helping the ship run smoothly while you are constantly engaged,	(b) (   and your family, the list goes on.

Hi again Paul,


One more question - is the pharma collaboration mentioned in the BioCentury story below the same thing as the Gates COVID Therapeutic Accelerator Program? Or is this something different?  I'mjust trying to understand the landscape.

Best, Francis


Pharmas on one page with action plan to solve COVID-19 together
BIOCENTURY IS PROVIDING THIS STORY FOR FREE GIVEN THE URGENT NEED FOR
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COVID-19 CRISIS.
BY C. SIMONE FISHBURN, EDITOR IN CHIEF  I MAR 25, 2020  I 9:17 PM EDT
A grand-sca le behind-the-scenes effort by the pharmaceutical companies is under way to expedite the creation of therapies and vaccines to treat COVID-19.


According to the participants who spoke with BioCentury under conditions of anonymity, R&D heads from at least 10 companies have been gathering several times a week, setting in motion an action plan to use their top talent in different disciplines to produce an industry-wide response, the likes of which haven't been seen since the private sector's coordinated contribution during World War II.

Regulatory heads and manufacturing heads have been holding meetings as well, coordinating to minimize duplication of effort, streamline work and advance efficient testing of compounds and vaccines.


The R&D group is creating working principles to accelerate new COVID-19 therapies and vaccines agnostic to their market potential, eliminating bureaucratic and technical or scientific barriers, and focusing on filling gaps not adequately filled by other initiatives and which the consortium is uniquely suited to address.

The pharma group's leaders also intend to offer resources to biotechs and academic groups pursuing countermeasures who may not want to join the effort but could benefit from expert guidance .

Flying the plane as they build it, the collaborators intend to create a clearing house of ideas for testing of molecules and vaccines, with working groups to vet the ideas and expedite testing on the most promising via clinical or preclinical testing.

According to the participants who spoke to BioCentury, the structure will probably evolve over time. Currently, the model involves five working groups, for clinical phase repurposing, novel small molecule antivirals, novel antibodies, preventive vaccines and preclinical repurposing. Each will be headed by a pharma R&D executive and will be responsible for prioritizing potentia l compounds and
s pecifying actions.


Two platform groups will integrate across modalities : a clinical trial acceleration group and a data sharing group.

"This is not a time to think about proprietary information or IP or margins. We need to break down the barriers and solve the problem," said one participant involved in the consortium .

Hi Paul,


I have done some work on the idea of an "AMP like" COVID project. As I mentioned, Mikael Dolsten has been quite enthusiastic. For FDA, Peter Marks, Janet Woodcock, and Steve Hahn were all extremely positive about this opportunity for a shared consideration about priorities. Tony Fauci and his team are totally in favor ,and the FNIH (David Whalley and Maria Freire) stands ready to serve as convener.  I thought the first step would be a 90 to 120-minute virtual meeting- hopefully next week.  Attached is a draft precis of what this might look like;I have left out the roster because that is very much a work in progress .

Meanwhile I saw reports that there are related partnership discussions going on amongst pharmas: https://www.globenewswire.com/news­ release/2020/03/26/2006713/0/en/Novartis -and-life-sciences-companies -commit­ ex perti se-a nd-assets-to-the-f i ght-agai nst-COVID-19-pa ndem ic-alongs ide-Bil 1- Melinda-G ates-Foundation. htmI

Subject: Reaching out about partnerships and COVID-19 Dear Paul,
I've been thinking that this is a time where we ought to have the best and
brightest minds from industry, NIH, academ ia, and FDA around the same table to identify ways that we can move the coronavirus agenda forward to
life-saving products as quickly as possible. Several pharmas and biotechs have been reaching out to NIH to identify viral assays and animal models that can

be run in a BSL-3 facility. Other similar contacts I've had with pharma and biotech tell me that there is a high degree of interest and willingness to combine forces at this time of crisis.

This isn't exactly a precise recipe for AMP-COVID, but it has some of the same flavor.  Would it be useful for FNIH to convene a virtual meeting with a few heads of R&D (hopefully you; Mikael Dolsten has already expressed enthusiasm; and I'd be interested in your suggestions of others), FDA (Marks and Woodcock), leaders from NIAID and a few other NIH Institutes with equity in this space. We might be able to make a short list of catalytic actions that neither sector can do optimally right now, but together we can do rapidly.

The focus would be on therapeutics and vaccines.  But Ican imagine a separate session on diagnostics.

Does this sound worthwhile to you?


Thanks, I always value your advice and partnership.


Francis

Subject: Medical staff need COVID-19 NIH surviva l data on N-95 respirators to help alleviate shortage Dear Dr. Fauci,
The biggest concern of my hospital colleagues is the shortage of protective masks. If any research is
being done that might drive safe reuse of N-95 respirators, no one I know has seen it. These should be
simple studies to do.


   If the virus is shown to die within a few days and moisture dries up, then the number of masks needing disposal could drop drastically.

  In that situation, each provider at risk could be given five N-95 masks, one for each day of the week. The provider would wear the N-95 mask for one working day, say Monday. and then place it into a paper bag in a secure location. The provider would not use that mask again until the following Monday; ie seven days later.

  The only question, then, would be: how many times can this be repeated?   Will the mask lose any protective qualities over time?

Please assign someone to do these studies soon.


I'm also very pleased that our national leaders now seem to be listening to you more closely. Thank you for your efforts.

Dear Dr. Fauci,



On behalf of the organizing committee, Iam writing to invite you to Keynote
the ath International mRNA Health Conference (http://www.mrna-conference .com/ ) to be held
at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel on Nov 9-10, 2020.

The International mRNA Health Conference is a yearly non-profit event collaboratively organized by Curevac, BioNTech and Moderna . It brings together academic and industry
thought leaders in the mRNA design and delivery space to explore the rapidly evolving science , business and regulatory landscape of mRNA medicines. Over the last seven years, this 2-day conference has become the premier destination for industry and academic professionals to network with colleagues,learn about the latest advances in mRNA technology, and to attend scientific presentations given by the most esteemed experts in the field. Notably, it is the only annual conference dedicated solely to mRNA therapeutics.




As a scientist with tremendous experience and the director of NIAID, the organizing committee thought that conference attendees would very much appreciate hearing about your thoughts about mRNA therapeutics, particularly vaccines, and any perspectives you wish to share.




The organizing committee recognizes that your calendar is likely filled years in advance, but we all have our fingers crossed that you might be able to fit this into your busy schedule.




I look forward to hearing from you.




all best wishes, Norbert





P.S.  In the event that the COVID-19 crisis is still curtailing travel in the fall, our backup plan would be to have a completely virtual meeting on the same dates. We plan to make that decision in late August/early September.

My family had been associated with the NCI through my uncle, Lou Wasserman, who was a researcher for a period of time.  Lou did much research on polycythemia vera and was a bemotologist at Mt. Sinai in NYC.  I'm glad that he's no longer around to witness the devastation of Covid-19.

I was impressed with your knowledge at the time of   (b)	diagnosis and I am even more so in these times of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Thanks for being the intelligent and informative face of the facts on the virus. There are many around the country who rely on your wisdom but also on your facts and data.

Stay well, stay healthy , and keep provid ing the country with what we need to know and do.

Subject: Request for your support in promoting new WHO recommendation for emergency response operation to provide universal access to mandatory hand hygiene against COVID-19   Importance:High

Dear Dr. Fauci


Please find enclosed the new WHO recommendat ion on establishing universal access to hand hygiene stations at thresholds of publicly accessible buildings and means of public transpo rt. It is now officially published at: https://who.int/who-documents-detail/interim-recommendations-on-obligatorv-hand­ hygiene-against-transmission-of-covid -19 Iattach a pdf copy for easy reference.

Iwould like to request your support in promoting the recommendation as part of an international emergency response operation providing universal access to mandatory hand hygiene and/or sanitation against COVID-19 infections. Provided it is now made available and made obligatory whenever entering

and leaving a facility to which the general public has access, it could become possible to prevent most smear infections by decontaminating all hands prior and after each possible contamination, both active or passive. In addition, the measure should massively reduce transmission of other viruses and bacteria currently burdening differential diagnosis of COVID-pneumonias.  Based on the excellent experiences made with the acceptability and adherence during Ebola outbreaks, repeated mandatory hand hygiene or sanitation should thus become an almost unconscious routine of everyday life for any person having to leave his or her private home in Corona-affected countries.

Ihave been asked by senior WHO emergency management to promote the WHO recomme ndation for rapid implementation with particular focus on current COVID-19 transmission epicenters  such as the USA. Providing a systematic access to hand hygiene stations and making their use obligatory prior to entering and whenever leaving any public facility will also provide a safety net whenever current restrictions on movements and commerce are to be progressively reduced.  Given the high resource settings in the current COVID-epicentres, and the negligible cost of implementing this public health emergency measure compared to prolonged mass confinement without safe exit strategy, Ido presume that the wherewithal to carry it out  will not be limiting factor .

Thank you for considering the collaboration in this emergency measure proposed within the USA at the largest possible sca le. WHO has requested IFRC to alert the American Red Cross to support large scale implementation should your Government decide to implement the public health measure proposed.

With best wishes for success in all of your endeavours, Stefan Hoyer

Subject: Association between Proton Pump Inhibitors and increased risk of Covid-19 death


Dr. Fauci,


There is a wealth of medical research papers about the association between Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) and increased risk of community acquired pneumonia. Long term use of PPls reduce the pH of the stomach from 1to 5. This reduction in stomach acid reduces the body's ability to fight viruses.

 In addition, the lower stomach pH reduce the ability to absorb key nutrients that require gastric acid for breakdown and absorption (calcium, vitamin C & 612, iron, magnesium, potassium,zinc). Lack of proper nutrients lead to a compromised immune system.


Seniors and individuals with chronic illnesses are at higher risk of ploypharmacology and dying from Covid-19 due to PPls. The more medications an individual takes, the more likely they will suffer from acid reflux and thus be prescribed a PPI.


Thank you for your commitment and compassion during the pandemic. God bless you. Regards,
Teresa McPeak

David:
 Thanks for the note. Since they both effected adequate quarantine, they are OK with each other....provided that they practice physical distancing with everyone else, i.e. 6 feet apart and masks when out in situations where they cannot guarantee 6ft distance . With regard to your second question, it is not a question of temperature, it is a question of what surface the virus in on - stainless steel versus cloth, versus cardboard. Each of these have differ time frames of survival of replication competent virus from a couple of hours to about 2 days.

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Early Successes in Clinical Trial on COVID-19 Patients with High Dose IV Vitamin C Thank you for the invaluable work that you are doing in guiding the United States through the current COVID-19 pandemic.
I hope that you do not mind me contacting you, but I wanted to bring your attention to a clinical trial that is currently taking place in China on COVID-19 patients with high dose IV Vitamin C.
There are reports of some early successes with this treatment and Iwondered if this could be a possible stop gap treatment - that could possibly save many lives - while we await the development of suitable drug treatments and a reliable vaccine.
The trial in China is not due to conclude until September of this year, however, previous trials of IV Vitamin C have shown it to be a very safe treatment with little or no adverse side effects. I have read that the Northwell Hospital Group in New York,which operates 23 hospitals, have already started to give this treatment
to many of their COV ID-19 patients.
This treatment also appears to meet the normally required criteria for a clinic trial. The treatment has been shown to be:
1) Effective (Please see the link below to the promising trial results currently taking
place in China).
2) Safe (The treatment has been shown to be safe in many previous trials going back well over 40 years).
3) Correct dosage is understood (The dosage is fully understood - please see the
attached Protocol).
4) The correct patients to give this treatment to (Virtually everyone in hospital infected with COVID-19).
5) The correct time in the illness to gi ve the treatment (As soon as the infected patient comes into hospital).

I hope that you and your team find the details of this clinical trial of some interest. The hospital protocol for this treatment is attached and here is a link to details of the current trial in China along with some other relevant links:

Hey Dr. Fauci-

My name is Zach Davis, I'm the founder and editor-in-chief at The Trek, a media company dedicated to long distance backpackers. Thank you for the tremendous service and leadership you've given this country during a time of great need.

I'm reaching out to inquire about the possibility of your doing a short interview for our flagship podcast , Backpacker Radio,the #1 rated hiking podcast on iTunes. We're putting together an episode related to how COVID-19 has impacted this year's class of backpackers, and would love to
feature your expert insight on why social distancing is important,and what the future may hold for our community.

The interview would be about 20-25 minutes, though if you're only available for a shorter period, we'll take what we can get!

Thanks for your time and thank you again for your terrific service to this country .

Happy hiking,

Hi Mr. Secretary,


Just wanted to let you know - we had a very productive and significant two-hour virtual meeting with leaders of industry, FDA, and NIH yesterday. Iattach the bios of those who attended - which includes the heads of R&D of nine major pharmaceutical companies. There is unanimous support for bringing together all of the sectors to accelerate development of therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Tony compared this to what happened in the early 1990s that led to successful antivirals for HIV.

Iattach the action items that came out of this meeting. Working groups for each of the four main topics wil l be rapidly organ ized. Iwill keep you posted.

Best, Francis

A great credit to NIH and NIAID...we're all very proud of you.


Iknow that you have long advocated preparation of viral vaccines against
future pandemic threats.
I'm sure that it has been difficult to convince pharmas, charitable agencies
and even the government to fund these efforts.
             which would include vaccine production and storage for indefinite periods.
Perhaps there will be a greater willingness to
revisit a cost-benefit analysis of this effort in the near future.


I would be happy to serve on committees, study sections etc. in an effort to
increase our ability to identify and fund first-rate
Immunology research that might accelerate innovative, safe and effective
approaches to improved viral vaccines going forward.

Tony-I received a note from Trevor and Bill that they connected with you yesterday and they asked me to reach out.  I've taken on the role of coordinating the foundation's contributions to the global COVID vaccine efforts, in particular for those approaches that are (or soon will be) in early development. There's an obvious need for coordination among the various primary funders or the focus we need to have given the state of the pandemic will become lost through uncoordinated activities .

Bill tells me that you will take on a central role in coordinating BARDA's funding to the ongoing efforts. And, of course, there are the NIH/VRC activities. I'm reaching out to ask how we can coordinate and cross-inform each other's activities. I am very sensitive to how busy you are and very grateful for your engagement. Isee you on TV almost every day, and although you continue to have considerable energy, Iam seriously worried about you. The nation and the world absolutely need your leadership.

As a next step we can connect 1:1briefly or you can pass this on to an appropriate member of your staff.

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Ithought that you may be interested in reading this paper (Unless you already know about this of course!).  This is obviously a data-driven set of correlative observations, but could be wo rth looking into.
Isalute your outspoken efforts to galvanize this country into action in the midst of so many mixed
messages and dragging of feet.

Hi Mary,

1hope you are staying well during these unprecedented times! I wanted to give you  a head s up that we will be un veili ng a bobb lehead of Or. Anthony Fauci this Friday. April 3rd. Dr. Fauci h as beco me America 's voice of reason  as one of the lead members of the 'White House Coronavirus Task Force. The  National  Bobblehead
Hall of Fame and Mu seum will be donating $5 from every Dr. Fauci Bobblehead
sold to the American Hospital Association in support of the l 00 Mill ion Mask Challenge ficm-tracking.meltwater.coml.  The bobbleheads will be avai l able for pre­ order on our website beginning on Friday.

Bobbleh eads are the  ultimate  nonor, and  we  think  Dr.  Fauci  deserves  it given  what he has done and cont inues to do for our country and  th e world  in  th e battle against COV fD- l9. The bobblehead will join a growi ng number of items includin g donuts, sock s and t-shirts featuring Dr. Fauci. We received a lot of requests for a bobblehead of Dr. Fauci and are excited to be able to use the bobblehead to raise funds for a
vital organization that is helping limit the spread of the Coronavims while makin g
people smile during these unprecedented times.

Let me know if you would Like the pres   release, pictures and graphics i n advance of Friday's release. Pl ease hold off on publicizing anything related to th e bobblehead until Friday-any time on Friday is okay. Please also let me know if you wou ld like a sample when they arrive or if you have any questions.

Colleagues,


The momentum behind a 4th COVID supplement seems to be building in the Congress even more quickly than we had expected. We have received a TA request to provide rough numbers for NIH efforts by Friday afternoon.  With regrets for adding more burdens to the intense efforts you are already engaged in, I ask that you submit a rough estimate of the first year and the five year budget for your (i) IC-specific initiative(s) and/or your (ii) proposals to contribute
to economic recovery, no later than Friday April 3 at noon. This will be non-binding, and you are
free to revise it for the submission that we already asked you for by Friday COE. The only thing we need Friday at noon is the budget - the narrative can come later in the day (or the night).


Please use the second page of the template we sent you yesterday to provide this draft budget.
Send to me.

Iapologize for the impossible turn-around and appreciate all the hard work that will be needed
to get us this information by the Friday noon deadline.


Many thanks,
Larry

Subject:  COVID-19 Planning Colleagues,
Francis is sending out a note shortly to the co-chairs of each of the ten trans-NIH initiatives, asking for their assistance in putting together workplans and budgets for those projects. But in addition to these trans-NIH activities, we invite ICDs to submit a short description of no more than two IC-specific ideas that you believe merit consideration for support in a fourth supplemental bill,should one be put forward. Please use the same template that is being used for the trans-NIH activities, but just check the appropriate tick box. Your submission should include budget estimates for the first year and subsequent outyears (for a total of 5 years).	(b)(S)
. Please send these to me by COE, Friday,

Finally, if we are asked about technical assistance regarding economic recovery, please send ideas for that option.As part of this, Mike Lauer and Michael Gottesman will submit estimates on what might be needed for extramura l institutions and the IRP to "make them whole" . However beyond that there are infrastructure , training, and other requests that would with help national economic recovery by creating new jobs (construction, IT,biomedical, etc.) and help prepare the nation for COV ID-202X. Please use the same template that will be used for the trans-NIH activities (again, checking the correct box) and include budget estimates for the first year and subsequent outyears (for a total of 5 years). Please send these to
me by COE, Friday, April 3rd.

Icontact you to have a discussion about the effectiveness of the epidemic outbreak preparedness and response measmes put in place by governments, particularly in term s of vaccine development.

Dear Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,

        My name is Brendan Taglianetti; I am a Full-Time Advanced EMT provider for Milford Ambulance Service in Milford, NH. Iwant to help relay your message of COVID-19 information for state of New Hampshire, by conducting a Facebook Live chat with myself to project information and messages to the citizens of New Hampshire. This is a chance for us to chat for around 10 minutes and ta lk with a
first responder to the general public.

      I have seen you do interviews with the media/ daytime talk shows, a Facebook live chat with Mark Zuckerberg, and even an lnstagram live video with Stephen Curry from the Golden State Warriors.



Irun the social media aspect of the department,and I would love to do a 10-15 minute discussion (with information to the public,as well as some question and answer) with you on Facebook (live) to have the general public watch us talk about the pandemic and the next steps, and also maybe take some questions asked of the public watchingwhen they comment. Ialso will be reaching out to the New Hampshire State Governor Chris Sununu and Dr. Benjamin P. Chan (who is the state's epidemiologist). I would love to have them chat with me,and have you join in on the discussion as well. I have no confirmed with them if they are available yet, but Iam putting things in motion.

      I know that if Iwas able to set up a time and date that would work around your busy and important schedule, then I could with ample time promote it. Iwould love to not only get the town on Milford to watch this, but have the state of New Hampshire and other states nearby tune in. Iknow this is a long shot and that you have way more important aspects of your job to complete, but Ithink this an important time to have the public hear you talk.

        Please let me know if this could be possible and Iwould love to set this up, Idon't expect to take too much of yourtime if this can happen. Sometimes in life you just need to ask and see what happens and this is a time where that risk is worth it to have a conversation with you about this pandemic we are facing, especial ly as we ramp up for starting to "peak" in the number of people affected.





NIH-000080

        Please let me know if this is possible and tell me if you are interested in doing this with us for the greater good of the general public to keep them informed.

Thank you for taking some precious time to hear from some of the folks on the ground confronting COVI0-19 around the country. I can't tell you how much we all value your engagement and leadership on behalf of the nation. I'd love to get your take on whether you think the types of things described it eh recent AEI report are realistic. Ihave serious doubts.

Quick question - Imentioned the problem we had with FEMA test kits being recalled from us because we did not want to use their call line and lab because too slow, -just wondering if that came up in your meeting today because Ijust heard the kits were released to us without restrictions on how we use them. So either way, apparently resolved.

                                      Doughnuts bearing the likeness of Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, rest on a plate at Donuts Delite in Rochester, N.Y., on March 25. (Shawn Dowd/Rochester Democrat & Chronicle/AP)
By
Antonia Noori Farzan
March 31, 2020 at 5:15 a .m. EDT
Early last week, Nick Semeraro wanted to find a way to honor Antho ny S. Fauci.As the owner of a small doughnut shop in Rochester, N.Y., he had been closely tracking the latest news about the coronavirus pandemic. And night after night, he'd been impressed by how Fauci,the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, approached the crisis in a calm, knowledgeable manner.
So, as a tribute, Semeraro put the renowned immunologist's face on a doughnut. Expecting to sell a few hundred, he was shocked when the store sold out day after day, with thousands flying off the shelves . Donuts Delite was besieged with requests to ship the buttercream-frosted creations all over the country,and one Fauci fan drove three hours just to pick up a dozen. Soon, bakeries in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania followed suit, using edible paper to decorate pastries with Fauci's likeness .
"We had no idea it was going to blow up this big," Semeraro told CNN."We didn't know everyone else felt the same way we did."
While Fauci was already a respected scientist before the outbreak,his appearances during White
House press briefings have made him a household name and an unlikely celebrity. With his

straightforward demeanor and willingness to contradict President Trump, he's begun to develop the same kind of cult following as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and former special counsel Robert S. Mueller 111, who inspired countless "Plank like RBG" tank tops and a bizarre illustrated children's book, respectively.
Even as whole swaths of the global economy collapse, the pandemic has created a robust cottage industry of Fauci-themed merchandise, including bottle openers, magnets and mugs. On Etsy,you can buy "Honk for Dr. Fauci" bumper stickers, prayer candles depicting "St. Fauci" and socks printed with Fauci's face. Graphic T-shirts bear slogans such as "I Need a Hero" and "In Dr. Fauci We Trust."
If so inclined, you can even decorate your home with an "I Heart Dr. Fauci" throw pillow, or purchase a replica of Fauci's je rsey from the time he captained the basketball team at Manhattan's Regis High School. Lingua Franca, which sells cashmere sweaters embroidered with resistance-friendly slogans for $380 and up, recently began taking orders for an army-green "Dr. Fauci Fan Club" knit.
In honor of Fauci's Italian heritage, a clam bar in Long Island named a linguine dish after him this week . (Available for pickup only, "the linguine with white clam sauce shares origins with Fauci, as the sauce itself was invented in the Fauci Family's native Sciacca, Italy," the restaurant claimed in a statement .)
As countless Americans remain glued to the news while trying to stay indoors, a robust Fauci fandom has flourished online. On Facebook, the "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci Fan Club" has over 32,000 members.
Thousands more congregate in groups with names such as "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Man, the Myth, the Legend," "Dr. Fauci Speaks, We Listen" and "Dr. Fauci Memes for Social Distance Teens."
An unassuming 79-year-old public servant who has advised six presidents, Fauci has become a "reliable constant in a time of uncertainty," The Washington Post's Ellen McCarthy and Ben Terris reported. But his admirers - and there are a lot of them - worry that it's only a matter of time before he's sidelined by Trump.
When Fauci missed a White House news conference earlier this month, panic erupted on Twitter, along with speculation that he could be sick. There was palpable relief when he resumed his regular position at the podium the following day and appeared to hide some exasperation as Trump referenced "the deep state."
Fauci later explained that he had simply been trying to dislodge a lozenge from his throat. But the much-analyzed "Fauci facepalm" had already become a meme, deployed by liberal members of what's known as the resistance.
Fauci's newfound fame can be partially attributed to his willingness to engage with all forms of media
- in recent weeks, he's gone on a Barstool Sports podcast, chatted with basketball star Steph Curry on lnstagram Live as Barack Obama listened in, and appeared on "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah." But it also undoubtedly helps that his fans tend to take social distancing seriously and consequently have ample spare time to produce fan art or perform songs written (or modified) in his honor.
On social media, Fauci's virtual fan clubs peruse old photos of the infectious disease expert in search of "comfy turtleneck vibes," stitch his face on embroidery hoops and discuss erecting statues as tribute.They frost his name on cookies and joke about constructing shrines in his honor. Prominent activists and entertainers confess to wanting to marry him, or have him tuck them into bed.
Fauci has remained characteristically modest about his new status as a cult figure. "Well, that's very nice," he responded when McCarthy and Terris mentioned that people all over the country were praying for him. Of course, that means that his fan base has only continued to grow .
"I never met a guy that, worldwide, he is so loved," Semeraro, the Rochester doughnut shop owner,told CNN. "And a month ago, we never knew his first and last name."

Dear Dr Fauci




I was just re-reading your January 23 Viewpoint article in JAMA. So little time has passed, but so much has changed, and your comments seem prescient.



I have been working on emergent/re-emergent infectious agents for some time, and authored a 2018 report for the UK government on vaccine responses that was summarised in a Vaccine publication last October attached. As almost everyone else, my attention has been redirected to Covid-19, although monkeypox remains a focus of my interest.

You and your colleagues may be interested in two short documents I produced for the UK

government on the 20th and 22nd of March. That also seems long ago now!



As fellow citizen of our planet, Ithank you and colleagues for your unstinting efforts to control infectious disease and Covid-19 in particular.

Warmest  wishes Karl

Attached are the paper and figure 3,which summarizes the data from 9 very diverse RCTs (overlapping with what Ihad sent earlier) .

Bottom line: generally there were not differences in Ill/URI/or flu rates when masks were used,
although when early use and compliance was taken into account, a few times a difference was seen .


In addition:
This case control study noted that,among SARS patients in Hong Kong without a known source of infection, cases (27.9%) were less likely than uninfected controls (58.7%) to report wearing a mask frequently in public, for what that's worth.

Itotally agree with you and this issue is being actively discussed as recently as today at the task Force meeting.   I am not sure what you mean by aerial "eradication" procedures that could be practically implemented.

If that is the case, then perhaps universal wear ing of masks in the most practical way to go.

For God's sake, Tony -- this is me, not simply an unknown "messenger" from the general public! We go back together for many, many years (to our days together at the NIH, remember?). As you may recall, we worked (successfully) during the infamous 1969 "March on Washington", among other historically im	ortant events.
Although	am now	(b)(6) Icontinue to pay careful
attention to world events, and this is one that exceeds any others that have occurred in our lifetime!


As I wrote in my previous e-mail, I have become convinced that COVID-19 is behaving as an airborne virus, and, therefore, we should be directing our mitigation efforts toward more comprehensive aerial eradication procedures!

Think about the most recent reports -- namely that imprisoned inmates, and
a young baby, have recently been reported as "infected" with this virus .

Person-to-person infection in these circumstances is difficult to explain! But transmission by viable airborne virus couldcertainly happen!

I look forward to your response, with best wishes,
David

Subject: Invitation to be the keynote speaker at an Insurance Medicine Conference in Washington, DC in October .

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Ihope this email finds you well.  It is abundantly obvious from the countless sifts through data and tallies of cases, interviews and press conferences, social media appearances, etc. that your schedule is crazy these days.  As a practicing physician and an American, Iam proud to be represented by you and thank you for your efforts on our behalf.  I realize with your schedule and with the thousands of emails, this one may not make it, but Iwanted to take a shot in the dark.

Iam currently the Chief Medical Officer of a reinsurer and am on the planning committee for the American Academy of Insurance Medicine's annual meeting which will be held in DC this year October 18-21. Dr. Michael Osterholm had agreed to speak at the conference back in January as our first
keynote speaker on the subject of pandemics, preparedness.  I'd heard him speak before at Prudential (I was medical director there and we were a member company of CIDRAP) and his talk mirrored his book which I've also read.  Regretfully, 2 weeks ago Ireceived notice from Laurel,his EA, that he is unable to attend the meeting because he needs to travel to London that week for a meeting he is heading.  Ithink that a talk on the topic is a must at any medical meeting and after hearing your pressers and coming to rely on your sage status updates and advice, coupled with the fact that the conference is in DC, Ithought I'd give this a shot . Would you be AAIM's keynote speaker this year?

In the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we understand many industry conferences have had to be canceled. We are continuing to closely monitor the trend of the COVID-19 virus, and may have to do the same for the AA IM meeting in October, but if there is an opportunity to gather and learn, we'd like to prepare for it.

The audience is medical directors that work in the life, health, disability and longterm care space. Some are clinically active. Some of them are resources for health emergency planning for their companies. The audience comes mostly from North America, although other countries/continents are well represented.

The purpose of the meeting is really to illustrate novel trends in the industry that will likely impact morbidity and mortality in the near or distant future. We've had talks on CRISPR, marijuana, precision medicine, data analytics. They're not hard core morbidity or mortality focused, but do touch on it.

Given the scope of the meeting and the attendees and industries they represent, Ithink that a lecture on pandemics, bioterrorism and emerging infectious disease, especia lly in light of COVID-19, is necessary . Ithink you wou ld teach new concepts to a team of doctors that would identify with some of the system gaps in our current supply chain and their impact on human health, wellbeing and survival.
You'd provide experience and insight on what went wrong and what could be fixed in the future to make us collectively better prepared.

We would be honored to have you speak and I'm glad to continue discussion of logistics with someone else on your team . If you needed more information about scope, Ican certainly provide that. We do provide an honorar ium and will cover travel and hotel expenses .

Thanks so much in advance for any consideration you might give this request/offer and most of allthank you for your direct ion, demeanor and dedication at this global time of crisis.

Best, Paulo

We would need 40 - 50 minutes of your time before Friday morning, but preferably by Thursday evening. The interview can be conducted over Skype/Google Hangouts/Zoom or whichever method of video chat you prefer.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I'm	(b) <	internist.


I have a suggestion for 2 potent antiviral agents, cheap and readily available, that may prevent viral shedding. No viral shedding? No infectivity. The concept is that EVERYONE should take these items.


First a short bio:


Dr. Josh Backon was affiliated with the Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine for over 33 years. He has a good track record (84+ publications quoted by over 750 other researchers in journal articles https ://scholar. google.com/scholar?start =O&g =%22backon++j.%22&hl

and in over 250-300 texts as per
https://www.google.com /search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q =0/o22backon+j. +% 22&num=100 ).
In the l 980's he was Consulting Editor of the Jomnal of Pediatric
Endocrinology, Editor ofReviews in Pure and Applied Phannacological Sciences, and Associate Editor of the International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health. From 1990-2004, he was a consultant

on emergency planning and management at Israel 's National Police Headquarters with Nitzav Mishneh Dannny Fisher.



Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, is now being used to treat Covid-19. Its mechanism was found in the 1970's to inhibit thromboxane https://scholar.google.corn/scholar?hl=en&as   sdt=0%2C5&g=chlorogui ne+thromboxane&btnG =	The problem with chloroquine was that it also elevated level   of prostaglandin F2alpha. In 1980, Sriva tava, an Indian biochemist working in Denmark found that GINGER i a potent inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase. I wrote a number of papers in the 1980 son use of ginger:

Dear Dr. Fauci ,

After reading the article about you on the front of the New York Times this morning , lwas distressed to learn that you have recently been negatively targeted via social media by members of a certain US political  faction.  Tue unfairness of these personal attacks upon you is shocking, and I cannot imagine something so hurtful happening to someone like you who possesses such a depth of knowledge and  unimpeachable  integrity. You are the affable, truthful and reassuring centre of calm during this deadly coronavirus  storm. Your job is difficult enough without people taking verbal pot-shots every time you speak.

1wish you all the best during this trying time. Stay well (and I hope you don't completely lose your voice, too)!
look fon.vard to seeing and hearing more from you on CNN and other media outlets.


.Best wishes ,

Iknow u r drinking from the proverbial fire hose so Iwould not send anything ur way ifl didn't think it may have merit to address our current challenge with Coronavirus.
I e mail introduced u to this group some time ago. Their science has advanced and in
particular there seems to be a potent i al opportunity to address the sometimes lethal "
cytokine storm" in some coronavirus patients as described in the attached e mail. So I forward to you for your consideration as an adjunct.
On a daily basis I receive numerous " ideas" to address coronavirus from many well intended people. A few have merit. Is there a Fed innovation review group that some of these potential ideas could be funneled too?
Ipray for you and your family

the US is like out big brother, we love you guys and would like to connect in solidar ity about COVID19 so I'm hoping that maybe you could find us sometime to have a chat over the internet. Some content
would also help us give some more content to Kiwi's who have gotten to the end of Netflix ;)

behind the fake news are targeting to you, one example is the post of an email that relates to you with the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. This is why Idecided to write a letter of support, Iam sick of fake news,persona l attacks and violation of the First Amendment, the 1ight to have an opinion,to civil servants serving this country.
>
> I am still young but I s1ill want to live in a United country. I ask you to continue your job, I want you to know that most Americans  regardless  of ideology are grateful of your service and sacrifice. A virus does not understand boundaries nor ideology ,Iam not an expert on this topic nor the president and lJOliticians. Please guide us with the truth in these dire and dark days.

Abstract
Summary Background The novel coronav irus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV -2 outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over 100 countr ies. SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor . Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID- 19 patients . It is controver sial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Ang iotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to invest igate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertens ion comorbid ity. The included COVID- 19 patients used ACEI , ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or thiazide to treat
preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs. Methods In this multicentre retrospect ive study, clinical data of 511 COVID- 19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categor ized into six sub -groups of hypertens ion comorb idity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI,ARB,CCB, BB, thiaz ide), or none . A meta-analys is
was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARB associated w ith pneumonia using published stud ies. Findings Among the elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=0.343, 95% Cl 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analys is showed that ARB use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumon ia . Interpretat ion Elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorb idity who are tak ing ARB anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertens ion drugs .

How the Vietnam War may have changed Anthony Fauci's life
nthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases,speaks with the coronavirus task force at the White House on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
By Ray Greenberg
March 27, 2020 at 3:34 p.m. EDT
Ray Greenberg is a physician epidemiologist,former executive vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Texas System and the author of "Medal Winners: How the Vietnam War Launched Nobef Careers."

Americans may have the war in Vietnam to thank for Anthony S. Fauci.
An adviser to six presidents and now the trusted public face of the scientific response to the coronavirus pandemic, Fauci has worked at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for more than a half-century - beginning in 1968 with a group of doctors cheekily known as Yellow Berets.
During the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, the U.S. military faced a pressing need for physicians. In 1966, during Fauci's senior year at Cornell University Medical College, a military recruiter came to tell the assembled students: "After you finish medical school, every one of you except the two women will
either be in the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, or the Public Health Service." The last option, entering the Public Health Service, entailed assignment at the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control or the Indian Health Service.
Those who were selected to serve at the NIH were known officially as clinical associates, but informally they were referred to as Yellow Berets. Whether the designation was born in jest or derision, it was intended as a foil to the Green Berets of the Army Special Forces. Fauci never liked the label because it implied an unwillingness to serve in harm's way. "As a physician," Fauci said, "I felt if I had to go [to Vietnam], I would gladly do my part to try to help."
The competition for the limited number of Yellow Beret slots was so intense that only the best and brightest young physicians were selected. Fauci, the top graduate in his medical school class, was one of seven chosen from 140 applicants to train in his laboratory of interest. As described in my book "Medal Winners: How the Vietnam War Launched Medi ca l Careers," the class of Yellow Berets that entered with Fauci included four future Nobel laureates:Joseph Goldstein, Michael Brown, Harold Varmus and Robert Lefkowitz.
Each new appointee completed two years of clinical training before arriving at the NIH. Their primary responsibility was learning how to conduct basic research under the guidance of a senior scientist. The second job was to care for patients at the NIH Clinical Center. Fauci and his fellow infectious disease colleagues also helped to care for wounded service members at the nearby National Naval Medical Center.
Fauci, who had some research experience in medical school, trained at the NIH for three years under the tutelage of Sheldon Wolff - a pioneer in the relationship between the immune system and infectious diseases . Following a year of additional clinical training back in New York, Fauci returned to the NIH as a senior scientist conducting pioneering work, first on autoimmune conditions, then transitioning to study the newly emerging disease that would become known as AIDS.
When he entered the clinical associate program, Fauci's ambition was to become a medical school professor. Had the Vietnam War not brought him to the NIH, Fauci probably would have remained in academia and the country never would have benefited from his extraordinary public service.
Instead, from his position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci has helped shape national policies related to HIV, bioterrorism and a series of pandemic threats including avian influenza, HlNl (swine) influenza, Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome. It is hard to imagine any other physician who has had such a sustained and profound impact on the health of our nation.
While Fauci remained at the NIH for his entire professional career, most of his fellow Yellow Berets left Bethesda after their training was completed and headed for jobs at universities.Across the nation, the former Yellow Berets became medical school scientists, department chairs and deans. More than 60 former clinical associates, including Fauci, were elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, and he also was one of the more than 125 Yellow Beret alumni elected to the Institute of Medicine {now the National Academy of Medicine) . In addition, Fauci was one of 10 alumni to receive the National Medal of Science.

For all the scars left by the Vietnam War, we should not overlook the fact that in its absence, 50 years later the country would probably not have Anthony Fauci guiding us through our current crisis. Dr. Fauci, we salute you and your fellow Yellow Berets.

Hi Patty: A few important updates. And a request for this weekend/Sunday.

(b)(4





















2) We have been wo rking with John Burklow/Dr. Collins/HHS on access to the Task Force. The Task Force came back to us and asked us for more details about our approach, we gave them a written description of the overall approach of document ingfor history the role of the Task Force, it's leadersh ip, NIH, NIAID, and Dr.Fauci. Burklow is working with us on this.

3) Could Ihave a ten minute phone conversat ion wit h Dr. Fauci this weekend, important- I
think-to update him on details personally.


4) We would like, if possible to start filming wit h Dr. Fauci this weekend . Could we film Dr. Fauciexiting his house and going to the live truck for Sunday morning interviews and then going back home or off to the WH. We wo uld then match that in the film with the feed from the truck of him sitting down and get archive from the shows he appears . We are close by. Zac (DP, who Dr. Fauci knows} has been in complete self-quarantine for two weeks before he left New York State and we are now here a week .He is completely good by self-quarantine rules
for above filming.


Thanks to the three of you for the wor k. The communication is life-saving. Ihave a couple of close friends on the frontline and they asked me to relay how deeply grateful they are for the work you are all doing.

Hi Patty:


Zac and I are here and situated. Iknow you are drinking through ten firehoses. Iwant to preserve sleep and health for Dr. Fauci. But it would be fantastic to have a 15 minute video (with distancing) Q and A in the garden of his house or in the house
this week--- what he is working on just scientifically-vaccines, treatments, disease
understanding. Iwant to capture the focus and urgency of the real time scientific work on COVID-19.  lfwe need to we can figure out how to do it with audio, but would love to see if we could do this in 15 minutes on video. Again, anytime this week .


Thanks,

Hi Tony, Hugh,and Emily
Hope you are doing well and getting a chance to pause (especially Tony!) after another breathless sprint
of a week .


The NIBIB community has unique capacity to design, build, and deploy an array of powerful biomedical technologies. Much of our attention over the past year has been on early disease detection and prevention, and the integration of digital/personal health with conventional medicine.The COVID-19 crisis seems to have many challenges that are ideally matched for our capabilities . With the $60M NIBIB will receive in the supplement, we are in a unique position to make a contribution.

Iam hoping we can meet w ith you to refine ideas and coordinate as we develop mechanisms to marshal these resources. Your insight will play an essential role in helping us move forward wise ly. NIBIB has never received anything remotely like this before and we are in unfamiliar territory .  Ithink it reflects, in part, the confidence---and hope, that people have in advanced technologies to change lives. We are determined to convert these dollars into tangible methods and devices and need your help in optimizing our strategy.

Iam forwarding my slide from the science presentation on Wednesday and my follow up emailto Francis and Larry to give you a sense of our direction (apologies for the information blast!). We have also been drafting a NOSIwith several topic areas that Iam adding below...note that we are in the process of condensing and refining these to simplify and more closely resemble our pay plan. Ihad a great conversation with Francis in a follow up call Thursday and he suggested	(b (5)







Ilook forward to your thoughts/comments and hope we (cc'd NIBIB leadership Jill Heemskerk and David George) can schedule a time to talk. Thank you for considering this, Iknow you are overflowing with emails and requests!  If it's easier to just give me a call, my cell is	(b) <   , I can give you the quick "cliff notes" summary.

Congratulations to all of you who made today's COVID-19 videos a tremendous success!  I know there were a lot of quickly moving, intricate parts and it went off flawlessly -all remotely, to boot ! Everyone worked as a team, under very tight timelines, and thanks to Renate, who orchestrated the FC Home Edition!  I know NIH staff will greatly appreciate the videos-they're chockful of content!  And special thanks to Dr. Fauci, who took time out of his "leisurely" day to devote more than an hour to the
ta ping-incredible!


You all make us very proud! John

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I hope all goes well. Iwanted to quickly follow up and see if you might be free for a quick interview on Monday- it would mean so much to include your voice in the piece.

Is there a time on Monday that might work for you? We can jump on the
phone for a 5 - 1O minute call if that works better for you. Best,

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I hope this finds you well and thank you for all the work you are doing. I run the digital magazine, Frame, which publishes interactive documentaries made for mobile phones. We are working on a story about the current effort to create a coronavirus vaccine and would love to interview you for the piece.

We've interviewed Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer, George Yancopoulos , and the piece will tell the story of Regeneron's push to create a coronavirus vaccine in record time. Iwas hoping you could speak to the broader issue of the often undercovered global threat of diseases and the lack of funding going toward infectious diseases.

Would you potentially be available for a short video interview sometime between 1Oam - ?pm EST tomorrow? Alternatively , would you be free sometime between 12pm - 2pm or 5pm - ?pm EST on Monday?

Look forward to hearing back and we'd be honored to have your voice in the story.

Here's a brief overview of Frame:

Frame is a newsmagazine that publishes interactive documentaries made for mobile phones. Every Frame story tells a compelling, human story that helps shine a light on a major social or political issue.
Frame stories include interactive features throughout ,from maps to timelines , that allow viewers to engage more deeply with the piece.

Few of us in the office have even seen Tony in recent weeks as he is down at the White Hose daily from early morning until late at night.

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Idon't want you to waste too much time in this stressful situation.


As the doctor in charge of the hygiene of the Berner clinic in Crans-Montana in Switzerland, as well as being in contact with my colleagues in private practice,Isee every day how important the need for information and consultation of the population in this situation of insecurity is. At the same time, we are under threat of a shortage of doctors if we have to strictly apply the federal swiss guidelines (Art. 10b and 10c, regulat ion 2 COVID-19) or if the wave of illness reduces the number of colleagues available for consulta tions.

Thank you for your time Good luck

Iknow Tony is the expert, but I thought this memo would be of interest and perhaps of help to him in
his battles.


The attached memo is from Dr. Paul Offit (U of Penn) and a colleague of his David Rubin.Tony may know
him, I would not be surprised.


But for you, Paul is one of the country's topic vaccinologists and virologists. Paul developed a vaccine for
a deadly disease .I know him well and he's the real deal. Next to Tony he is my go to science source.


Paul in particular is a highly credible,well known national expert.


They wrote this memo on the 19th of March and it has many suggestions that are incredibly smart and I thought tony would want to see this immediately. Paul and David are obviously available to talk asap.

Let me know.

I've been a little reluctant to do that because of wha t I assumed must be a flood of comments and advice that you are getting in your role on the task force.

Dear Jon: Greetings from La Jolla. Congratulations on your interview with Tony Fauci. I have to admit that, until a couple of weeks ago, Ihave been quite critical of Tony's apparent acquiescence with so much dangerous, incorrect and politically motivated misinformation from the administration. Ifeared that the upside-down explanations from the administration had the effect of destroying the concepts and tenets of epidemiology and even rationalizing a completely wrong concept of communicable disease that holds that it is unnecessary to screen for carriers in an epidemic but only important to screen symptomatic people.That is upside-down from what we all know about dealing with epidemics and has even been endorsed by Trump, Pence and other members of the COVID-19 task force. It seems to have become a new normal concept of communicable disease management. Like so many things in the Trump era, facts and history are thrown out the window and replaced by governmentally espoused but obviously wrong concepts. We assume to be preparing to completely deny established concepts of communicable disease - screen only the prime suspects or the afflicted. In conversations with colleagues here Iwondered "where is Tony Fauci?" They suggested that he must be quietly and heroically working hard being the scenes and at his personal peril to educate our leaders rather than correcting them publicly. But Ithought that, in desperate times, the public
must hear and see clear truth and denials of lies. My concept of heroes are people who act at their personal peril - Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Martin Niemoller, Dietrich Bornhoffer, Thankfully, Ithink that the real Tony Fauci has emerged, obviously to his peril. I wish him good luck and survival. Ifind myself wondering what the responses will be to Trump's likely premature lifting of isolation and quarantining procedures and if the
concept of disobeying illegal and unethical orders will survive the times.

Yes, George has received ample criticism, but my job is to air his views, regardless of what I think. And I like his independent, damn the torpedoes approach. He speaks his mind. As for He, everything about this is bizarre, from ethics to science to PR to regulation.

Hello Jon - Greetings frorn	(b) ( . It has been a long time since
we last connected and talked about gene therapy, etc. and
-. (.b-<C('76"")'



 Iwas very interested to read George Church's troublesome responses in your interview with him in Science and to see his ethical  evaluation  of  He's  CCRS  editing experiment   in China.  I'm not as generous to He as George seems to be and Ithink that this work is clearly unethical. George inexplicably conjures up the sad history of Jess Gelsinger and the effect of his death on the evolution of the field of gene therapy. Happily, he's right about the fact that gene therapy is now proving itself in a
growing list of intractable diseases (underscored by the 2015
Japan Prize) .That has happened because studies are now much more carefully designed and carried out. But sadly, we are in an environment in which some people conclude that human medical manipulations - gene therapy, genome editing, stem
cell therapy - are ethical as long as they "work". The rationale is,
"let's do the study and if it works and doesn't kill or otherwise harm, it's OK". It's not a post-factor evaluation that determines if an instance of human experimentation is ethical and permissible - it is the design of a study that determines if it is ethical or not. George should be reminded of that fact and should re-read the Helsinki declarations or similar codes of human experimentation.
In any event, your interview was fascinating. Best regards,


Ted Friedmann

Here are reconfigured charts which factor in the guidance from mathematicians at Rockefeller . As you can see, the
trend in the U.S. is visibly worse. Ifthis pattern holds, we're going to see many more deaths before things get better.

RE: France situation COVID-19




Jean-Francois:
 Thank you for your note.	I do not see Yazdan copied on your e-mail, andl so please forward this e-mail to him.  The NIH position is that we should preferably make drugs available on randomized, controlled clinical trials and not freely distribute  them.  There  is  a  strong  push in the  USA, favored  by the  President, to make certain of these drugs more widely available outside of an RCT using mechanisms such as "compassionate usage".	In the USA, as you know,HC (plaquenil) is an approved drug for malaria as well as for certain autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Thus,physicians can prescribe the drug on an "off label" usage.  This likely will be the major modality of distribut ion of this drug in the USA, at least for the foreseeable future.
I am copying Cliff Lane on this e-ma il.   Please include him on any further
correspondence on this subject. Best regards,
Tony

Subject: France situation COVID-19




Hello,





Iam once again in service since the global sanitary crisis COVID-19 hit France a couple of weeks ago. I
am now leading the Scientific Council for COVID-19, composed of 10 persons, serving the French President , Emmanuel Macron .

The Council was created on March the 10th and we were heavily involved in advisory activities in relation to the President's decision to put the generalized quarantine into force, because we didn't have any
better choice.





Firstly





We have a limited number of diagnosis tests, this prevents us from taking up a Korean-like strategy  within the next few days. However, by the end of the quarantine (within the following six weeks), we will be able to have a generalisation of the diagnosis test and develop korean-like apps, as well as a strategy for testing and treatment if we have any drugs available by this time. Before this, we will go through a difficult phase in the following weeks, because we won't have enough beds in our care units in some part
of France ...





Secondly



On the therapeutic level, Yazdan Yazdanpanah has taken my place and who is now leading REACTing. Tomorrow morning a french-european medical trial will begin, under the control of the WHO, with 5 arms
(placebo/kalatra/kalatra +interferon beta / product of Guilead / hydroxychloroquine alone or in
combination for next week).


As you may know, we are currently facing a press buzz since the announcement made by Dr. Raoult about the effectiveness of hydroxy-chloroquine. His data is not particularly convincing. We can distinguish a slight positive signal but it must be confirmed by a well made randomised trial. We also started a monkey-model study with HC and we should have the results by the end of next week. Also a cohort of severe COVID+ patients have been created and some will be treated with HC : we will analyse those results with all the consciousness needed. It will also be possible to do a prevention trial for healthcare

professionals and aging people with HC. Ihave an enormous political pressure to release HC and to give
it to everyone butIam currently resisting ...




How is the situation in the USA, especially after Trump's announcement ? What is the NIH position ?
What will be put into force ?





Thanks for your answer .





Iput Yazdan Yazdanpanah in a copy of this email.

Subject: with love from Italy


 Dear Doctor Fauci. My name is Rita Apgar and if by chance you noticed my last name, as my father said many years ago, '	(b) (6)1" I have lived in Italy for almost SO years and the sagacious finger of desti ny pointed my way to Italy, the true home of my heart, although not a drop of Italian blood flows through it. But the love of Italy and the Italians pumps through my heart every second of my existence .
That sagacious finger of destiny pointed the way,and Ifollowed it in faith to	(b)(6)
 where Ihad lived. As soon as I set foot for the first time in the house in this funky ghost town of a medieval village, Ifelt that we belonged together. And, practically speaking, at the time, it was the perfect solution to some weighty personal problems. Heart and mind were in peaceful agreement.
Ihave a dear friend who is an infectious disease specia list at the hospital in Asti. She is, obviously, extreme ly busy these days but she took the time to call me Sunday evening and we talked about you. She said to me, "you know, when Iwas just a graduate student, Iwas a secret groupie of Dr. Fauci, and once when he was at a meeting or a conference or something (I'm not sure where or when) I was able to ask him a few questions ." Iwas thrilled,of course, since I also try to watch every appearance you make on TV. I will not add anything in this regard.

But I did say to Maria, Doctor Maria Degioanni, "Maria, I want to invite Dr. Fauci to come and visit us for a few days when this crisis is over, God willing and maybe he would come together with	(b) (6) . who has promised to come and visit again after 20 years. We can put them                                         up in the fancy Relais San Damian above lsolalunga where I live and take them out to dinner at Gente di
Mare. Dear Doctor Fauci, Ilike to joke when people ask how we are doing in this time of Covid-19 by saying : A Name, a guarantee: ISOLAlunga = ISOLAtion I Legend says that the Benedictine monks who got into mischief centuries ago were sent here as punishment to work in the olive groves: long isolation. Today it's the perfect place to be with a view of the Mediterranean as well as the Maritime Alps from the kitchen window and hardly a soul to practice social distancing with!
Grazie per esistere as an Italian song goes, "thank you for being you! Iwould adore getting a reply from you, but realize how miraculous that woudl be! We would be over the moon if you accepted our invitation, at any time and at the drop of a hat!

Sincerely, Rita Apgar

Dear Dr. Fauci,


The home care industry cares for tens of millions of our most vulnerable citizens in their homes every day.  We provide assistance with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, which keeps our clients in their homes and in the lowest risk setting. Our professional Caregiver s are able and willing to continue to provide care to clients who test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus.

But we need your help so that home care companies do not face unreasonab le liability for providing such care. To that end,we ask for your support in getting a bill through congress like the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act),42 USC 247d -6d, that will insulate providers like us from claims related to the care we will be providing in these extraordinary times.

We also ask that you support creating a fund that will provide appropriate personal protective equipment to our caregivers . Our clients should not have to bear the additional burden of the added cost of PPE.

Additionally, we would like you to encourage the CDC to clarify its guidance on caring for COVID-19 patients (found here, here and here) that the guidance is applicable to "professional, licensed and insured, home based care agencies."

This clarification will give the industry a workable standard to protect caregivers caring for COVID-19 clients. In essence, it would establish that facemasks and gloves are sufficient PPE to care for COVID-19 clients in the home, and not require its caregivers to comply with the healthcare setting requirements of wearing N95 respirators, eye protection (goggles or face shields) or gowns. This is important as a practical matter because respirators and gowns are not readily available at this time. Moreover, most home care workers are not trained in the proper use of respirators.

Finally, we need your help in pressuring congress to provide day care for the children of our caregivers. If they cannot find adequate care for their children, then our clients will suffer. This is a vital step to keep our clients in their homes.

With you help, home care companies will be able to:

1. Relieve the burden on the healthcare system by keeping our clients out of the hospital; and



2.	Adhere to shelter-in-place measures which will flatten the curve of COVID-19's spread.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is a study of calm and competence in the middle of a pandemic. Which makes him an endangered species, working as he does for a boss who is notoriously insecure and made his name shouting "You're fired!" on a reality TV show.

Dr. Anthony  Fauci is a bum.
A quack,a snake oil salesman.
He got his degrees online, not from Holy Cross and Cornell. He w atches Wheel of Fortune but not Jeopardy.
He's a Yankees fan.
Such character assassination is unsavory but necessary because Fauci's calm, reassuring competence in response to the coronavirus pandemic is placing him at serious risk of hearing the words that made his boss famous: You're fired.
President Trump is watching and listening to the same thing we are, i.e., Fauci going to the podium to rebut with facts the latest outbreak of paranoid anxiety or the president'sregu larly reckless statements.

Fauci is an oasis of rigor and reason in a barren desert of confusion and fear.
Which,given who he works for, makes him an endangered species.
During the Vietnam War, some US Army officer supposedly suggested that in order to save a village from the Vietcong they had to destroy it.
And so, to save Dr. Fauci, we must destroy him - at least in Trump's eyes.
Now that might sound crazy, but we're dealing with a crazy president in crazy circumstances. It's not as if there's no relevant precedent here.
Twowords:BillBratton.
Two other words: Rudy Giuliani. Who happens to be Trump's BFF.
Before Giuliani grew old, deranged, and more qualified to be a spokesman for Miracle Ear than the president's lawyer, he was the reform-minde d mayor of New York City.
Rudy rode into Dodge, which is what Times Square resembled at the time, and vowed to clean it up. His
hand-picked sheriff was Dorchester's own Bill Bratton.
As police commissioner, Bratton did much to stem violent crime in the nation's biggest city, but even more remarkably got his cops to reduce the incidence of more minor, so-called quality of life crimes that

had made New York less livable, from the tony sections of Manhattan to the Tony Fauci sections of Brooklyn.

Bratton did his job too well. He ended up on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as the guy who pulled the worm out of the Big Apple. He became more popular than the mayor.
This drove Giuliani nuts. Rudy had to be the smartest guy in the room, had to get all the credit. Sound familiar?
So Bratton had to go.
That wasn't Bratton's first rodeo. Long before he landed in New York, he became the face of progressive, modern policing in his hometown, the youngest-ever Boston Police superintendent. Police Commissioner Joe Jordan resented his overly-ambitious No. 2 so he busted Bratton.
The point is, insecure bosses don't like being shown up by smarter, more competent subordinates. Small
men make big mistakes.
It may be too late to save Fauci. He just got the star treatment from Maureen Dowd in The New York Times.
There used to be a thing called the Sports Illustrated curse, that after an athlete appeared on its cover his or her career tanked.
Similarly, being in the Trump administration and getting praised by The New York Times is the kiss of death.
Now, normally, you could print something in the Times and chances were the president wouldn't read it. He routinely dismisses the Gray Old Lady as fake news, except when his and his family's lousy books are mass- bought onto the newspaper's  bestsellers list. He is not fond of polysyllabic words and prefers to get his news from "Fox & Friends" or whatever white nat ionalist website his aide Stephen Miller might recommend.

But Trump reads Mo Dowd because they have known each other forever and she writes about him at a nuanced, personal level that drives him especially cuckoo.
We're way past the theoret ical here.
Tony Fauci is in real danger, and by extension so are the rest of us who expect - nay, pray for - one person in the White House to be trustworthy and competent in a time of unprecedented crisis.
So, again, repeat after me, Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum. Long live the bum.

Subject: Washington Post fact check on Fauci/scientists story Hi Patty,
Thanks very much for your help yesterday and hope you're doing well. We're wor king on a story today about Trump's relationship w ith the scientific and medica l experts in the coronav irus response,including Dr. Fauci. We're reporting this out today but wanted to send you what we've been hearing as we get it so there's ample time to fact check
everyt hing today. Here are some points we'd love to discuss with the best person in your
office or,better yet, Dr. Faucihimself.


 Fauci was apoplectic about Trump's tweet yesterday saying the cure couldn't be worse than the virus and indicating that he wants to reopen businesses soon.
 Fauci has been forceful privately that unproven drugs should not be advertised to Americans as a panacea (and he of course has publicly spoken about these drugs).
 We are also reporting in a separate story that Larry Ellison is building a website for the federal government that will collect data on the efficacy of remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Our understanding is Fauci is vehemently opposed to this idea and has pushed back on it, citing patient privacy concerns with the website and collecting data in this way outside of an approved FDA trial.

Again, we'd love to speak with Dr. Fauci and any others in your office who may have insight into these particular issues and other aspects of the coronavirus response. Please feel free to give me a call on my cell at any time at	(b)(6)
Thanks very much, Yasmeen Abutaleb

Coronavirus hero: Anthony Fauci is a great public servant in a time of great public need

Fauci is the world's leading authority on infectious diseases and the best person in the country to help us deal with the COVID-19 crisis.

David M. Rubenstein Opinion contributor
Some viewers of the daily White House coronavirus briefings may wonder why everyone increasingly defers to a diminutive, Brooklyn­ accented 79-year-old doctor, Tony Fauci.

They do because, as I have learned over many years of talking with and more recently interviewing this man, he is without doubt the world 's leading authority on infectious diseases.  In any area of human activity or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard.  In the world of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci.

So the American  people -indeed, people  around  the globe -should be grateful that Tony has dug into this crisis with the same work­ around-the-clock, just-the -facts ma'am style that he has used
while serving under and working with six U.S. presidents. He is as apolitical as anyone can be. I have no idea if he is registered with any political party; I suspect though that he is rabidly Independent. His only focus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment and information possible, and saving lives.

A top expert from AIDS to Ebola

Tony Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health in 1968, after
completing his medical training at Weill Cornell Medical Center, and
he has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984 -36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be at the top of his game. But Tony is. During this period, he
has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge -malaria,

Among Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply running the institute and training dozens of the world's top infectious disease professionals, has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS and, later, leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush's direction) the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has transformed the treatment of HIVIAIDS in Africa, and other parts of the developing world. Millions of lives have been saved by this program alone. More recently , he has been an architect and powerful advocate of President Donald Trump's plan for ending the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to disease hotspots .

Inhis spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and several textbooks, and, in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire medical profession.

For these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half century (he worked at NIH for 16 years before assuming his current role), Tony has received, and earned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called the American Nobel by many).

With this long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony
would let it get to his head , at least a little bit. Not the case, though.

Selfless commitment to public service

He is readily accessible to those who need treatment -he still runs a lab at NIH -or need information. Tony still lives in the same house he bought when he first moved to Washington, and it is there that he and his wife Christine have raised their three talented daughters (though none of them chose to attend medical school).

Until the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH
by Metro, typically after running three miles for his daily exercise. And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capitol Hill, he invariably turns down a car and driver for
the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for the obvious
reasons).

There are, of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also view their commitment to the country and its people over financial rewards. But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed Tony Fauci's long-tern1 and selfless commitment to this country and the health of its people.

<image002.jpg>

I tried years ago, when Tony was approac hing a norma l retirement age, to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federal service, to take some of his considerable skills and knowledge to the private sector. He quickly said no -money did not motivate him, serving the country
did. And he stayed at NIH -to the country's good fortune.

If there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal with the COVID-19 crisis, it is Tony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer.

He is not a miracle worker. No one is.

But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease problems and prescribe a treatment tl1at should, in time, provide the requisite comfort, even if, in the short term, the medicine is painfu l and inconven ient.

S.\Ibject: Meeting on the science of COVID-19, Wed. 3/25, 2 - 5 pm Colleagues,
I'm glad to hear that most of you are able to join a three-hour virtual meeting on Wednesday March 25 to discuss scientific opportunities in the effort to conquer the COVID-19 pandemic. While NIAID rightly has the lead in this effort for NIH, and is deeply invested in projects in both their intramural and extramural programs, it's clear that a number of other ICs have creative ideas and a strong motivation to try to help with this
global crisis. So this certainly seems like a time where we should gather (virtually of course)

to brainstorm together, led by NIAID, and seek to identify any additional areas of
contribution that could be subject to acceleration and/or collaboration.


Hilary Marston recently convened a Deputies meeting on this subject, and ICs were then asked to submit examples last Friday of projects they are pursuing in the COVID-19 space. Those were forwarded from Bob Eisinger to me. Ihave used those submissions, including a detailed list of NIAID projects, to put together a tentative agenda for Wednesday's meeting. That is attached.

(b)(S









There are admittedly a lot of themes and topics here, so this will require some real discipline in the one-slide presentations. Iwill try to serve as time-keeper- or maybe I'll ask Larry to do that.  DD

All IC Directors are invited to have one or two subject matter experts join them for this virtual discussion.

Ashley Parker	(b)(6l will be helping me with the logistics and will have further instructions about how the log in will work.

Here's the specific follow up request that needs your immediate attention:
1. If your IC is pursuing a highly relevant project that's not listed here, and that you want the group to hear about, please send me that information ASAP.
2. If your IC is on the draft agenda to make a presentation, please submit your one
slide (except for NIAID, who gets more) to me and Ashley by COB Tuesday 3/24. That way we can put the whole set together as a single ppt file.

Many thanks! This should provide a welcome respite from the many other tasks we are all facing right now.

Francis

Subject:	Invitation to join the HHS Panel on Guidelines for The Management of COVID-19





Dear Colleague,


At the request of the Office of the Secretary, HHS and in conjunction with the White House Task Force we are creating a COVID-19 management guidelines panel to provide frequently updated information to the public regarding the treatment of patients with COVID-19.


This guidance will be an HHS document, will be updated frequently and will be modeled to some degree after the ART guidelines. The Panel will include academicians and clinicians currently caring for persons with COVID-19 and representatives from multiple US government agencies (CDC, BARDA, FDA, VA, DoD) and professional societies. Cliff Lane, M.D. Henry Masur,
M.D. and Trip Gulick, M.D. will co-chair, and Alice Pau, Pharm.D. will be the exec. sec. for this new panel. Those of you who are appointed to represent your federal agencies will be ex­ officio.  Other federal employees will be voting members.


Iwould like to invite you to be a member of this new Panel based on your expertise. We anticipate that work will begin this week and we hope to be able to put out the first guidance in 1-2 weeks. We appreciate your willingness to join this very important effort and your work in caring for patients during this pandemic.

The first meeting (by teleconference) will be Tuesday,March 24 at ll:OOAM EDT. More details will be provided soon.


Thank-you for considering this and for all you are doing during this most challenging time.


Sincerely,

Coronavirus hero: Anthony Fauci is a great public servant in a time of great public need Fauci is the world's leading authority on infectious diseases and the best person in the country to help us deal with the COVID- 19 crisis.
David M. Rubenstein
Opinion contributor
Some viewers of the daily White House coronavirus briefings may wonder why everyone increasingly defers to a diminutive, Brooklyn-accented 79-year-old doctor, Tony Fauci.
They do because, as I have learned over many years of talking with and more recently interviewing
this man, he is without doubt the world's leading authority on infectious diseases.  In any area of human activity or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard. In the world of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci.
So the American people - indeed, people around the globe - should be grateful that Tony has dug into this crisis with the same work-around -the-clock, just-the-facts ma'am style that he has used while serving under and working with six U.S. presidents. He is as apolitical as anyone can be. I have no idea if he is registered with any political party; I suspect though that he is rabidly Independent. His only focus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment and information possible, and saving lives.
A top expert from AIDS to Ebola
Tony Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health in 1968, after completing his medical training at Weill Cornell Medical Center, and he has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984 - 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be at the top of his game. But Tony is. During this period, he has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge - malaria,
Among Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply running the institute and training dozens of the world's top infectious disease professionals, has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS and, later, leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush's direction) the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and other parts of the developing world. Millions of lives have been saved by this program
alone. More recently, he has been an architect and powerful advocate of President Donald Trump's plan for ending the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to disease hotspots.
In his spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and several textbooks, and, in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire medical profession.
For these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half century (he worked at NIH for 16 years before assuming his current role), Tony has received, and earned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called the American Nobel by many). With this long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony would let it get to his head, at least a little bit. Not the case, though .
Selfless commitment to public service

He is readily accessible to those who need treatment - he still runs a lab at NIH - or need information. Tony still lives in the same house he bought when he first moved to Washington, and it is there that he and his wife Christine have raised their three talented daughters (though none of them chose to attend medical school).
Until the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH by Metro, typically after running three miles for his daily exercise. And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capitol Hill, he invariably turns down a car and driver for the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for the obvious reasons).
There are, of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also view their commitment to the country and its people over financial rewards. But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed Tony Fauci's long-term and selfless commitment to this country and the health of its people.















I tried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age, to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federal service, to take some of his considerable skills and knowledge to the private sector. He quickly said no - money did not motivate him, serving the country did. And he stayed at NIH - to the country's good fortune .
If there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal with the COVID-19 crisis, it is
Tony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer. He is not a miracle worker. No one is.
But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease problems and prescribe a treatment that should, in time, provide the requisite comfort, even if, in the short term, the medicine is painful and inconvenient.

Hi Tony,
I'm forwarding an email I just sent to Paul Cieslak, MD.....one of the lead docs at the Oregon Health Authority	Cb>C6l ; he
gives my clinic's Internal Medicine docs an 'ID Update' for my CME Grand Rounds
each yea r)  ...with this email note from Dr. David Brandon ...hope you remember David....he was with Lynn's & Mort Lipsett's group at The Clinical Center.


...I'd bet a coke you know all about pooled sampling .....but wanted to pass it along.


You have no idea how many people tell me that your COVID-19 messages on TV, etc. are top flight, enormously helpful and encouraging for them with the best information, in a sea now of poor information.

Andrew Cuomo is also doing a great job informing all of NY (and the rest of us)
about what's going on, and his expectations for the public. Whatever they're paying you   ...it's not enough.
You keep your powder dry, and extra flints in your pocket! Barry

Good morning, Paul.


Hope you guys at OHA are holding up OK.


I'm fine,family is  fine.

-------is dong lots of telemedicine and seeing actual PEDS

patients at Westside Hosp. now a few days a week.
My clinic is still open but pretty quiet... we need to stay open at some level no matter wha t.


One of my colleagues from the NIH (Dr. David Brandon ...he actually published with Tony Fauci back in the late '70s I believe !)..sent me this email on Saturday morning
Isuspect you all know about pooled sampling,.....David did it at the NIH for a study that I have long forgotten about.  ...thought I'd pass it along to you ......




11  Ijust looked up to see if pooled sampling has been used to detect viruses in the past, and found that it has been used in a number of cases including during the HIV scare. I am including a  link thttps ://www.israel2lc.org/israelis-int roduce-method-fo r-accelerated-cov id-19-
testing/ to an article in the lay press reporting on an RT-PCR based test that uses swabs from
30-60 individuals to determine if the pooled sample has Covid-19. The study was successful and they are developing it to test workers in the front line work places such as hospitals. There is a body of literature using this method for other mass screenings."



Then I heard that CEP HEID will be getting their Genexpert instrument validated to measure COVID-19.	Turns out we have one in my Lab, use it for Chlamydia & Gonorrhea (we have lots of patients here needing this testing).   But as you so well know, having the instrumentation without the collection swabs/M4 media, etc. Is a bit like biking up a  blind alley.   I would hope we'll hear more about this.


Give me a shout if I can do anything to help you all	......best tack for me, I believe, is to stay out of your way!

Hi Tony-
1 know you are very busy but Iwanted to see if you know of any effort on the part of the federal government to issue guidance oh the rationing of ventilators when the time comes? Many of my colleagues in critical care across the country have been asking for some such guidance on a federal level. Both for the guidance itself and to protect themselves from legal liability. Are you aware of any such efforts? Thanks for any insights on this. And thanks for all you are doing on the coronavirus effort!

said that NIAID was working hard on developing a vaccine for EV-068. I have two questions:

1. Is work on developing a vaccine against the novel coronavirus interrupting or slowing work on EV- 068? Hard to believe it wouldn't have an effect.

2. When things calm down with COVID-19, would you consider allowing me to write a biography about you, or helping you write a memoir? This pandemic has kind of turned you into the face of medical science in the United States. I'm the author of four prior science books, and have profiled countless scientists in the Times, The Atlantic, and elsewhere . I know this is not the time for such things. Ijust want to put the idea out there.I hope and pray you do not find it offensive for me suggest such a thing at this time of danger and stress.

Mechanism of action[edit]


The mechanism of its actions is thought to be related to the selective inhibition of viral RNA­ dependent RNA polymeraseV 11Other research suggests that favipiravir induces lethal RNA transversion mutations, producing a nonviable viral phenotype.l 121 Favipiravir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate  (favipiravir-RTP), available in both oral and intravenous formulations.[I 3J[l4J Human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  (HGPRT) is believed to play a key role in this activation process.[1 5] Favipiravir does not inhibit RNA or DNA synthesis in mammalian cells and is not toxic to
them_[!] In2014, favipiravir was approved in Japan for stockpiling against influenza pandemics.l 161 However, favipiravir has not been shown to be effective in primary human airway cells, casting doubt on its efficacy in influenza treatrnentV 71


Approval status [edit]


In2014, Japan approved Favipiravir for treating viral sti·ains unresponsive to current antivirals.[181 Toyama Chemica l initially hoped that Avigan would become a new influenza drug that could replace Tamiflu. However, animal experiments show the potential for teratogenic effects on fetuses, and the approval of production by The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare was greatly delayed and the production condition is limited only in an emergency in Japan.l 19]

In March 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration completed a Phase III clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in the n·eatment of influenza.[20]

On March 15, 2020 the drug was approved in China with the name Favilavir for the treatment of intluenza.[21] The drug was also approved for use in clinical trials for treating coronavirus
disease  2019  pneumoniaV 1J

On 22 March, 2020 Italy has approved the drug for experimental use against COVID-19 and has begun conducting trials in 3 regions most affected by the disease.[22] The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency, however, has reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of this drug is
scant and preliminary.(23)


Ebola virus trials[edit]


Some research has been done suggesting that in mouse models Favipiravir may have efficacy against Ebola. Its efficacy against Ebola in humans is unproven.l241[25][26] During the 2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak, it was reported that a French nurse who contracted Ebola while
volunteering for MSF in Liberia recovered after receiving a course of favipiravir. [27] A clinical trial investigating the use of favipiravir against Ebola virus disease was started in Gueckedou,
Guinea, during December 2014.(281Preliminary results showed a decrease in mortality rate in
patients with low-to-moderate  levels of Ebola virus in the blood, but no effect on patients with high levels of the virus, a group at a higher risk of death.l291The trial design has been criticised by Scott Hammer and others for using only historical controls.[30J The results of this clinical trial were presented in February 2016 at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections (CROI) by Daouda Sissoko[3 l] and published on March 1, 2016 in PLOS
Medicine. [32]


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[edit]

On 17 March 2020, Chinese officials suggested that Favipiravir seemed to be effective in treating COVID-19 in Wuhan and ShenzhenV31[34)[35l

A study on 80 patients comparing it to lopinavir/ritonavir found that it significantly reduced viral clearance time to 4 days, compared to 11 for the control group, and that 91.43% of patients had improved CT scans with few side effects.[36J[37J

As of 23 March 2020, it seems that Japan and China have issu ed an export ban on the substance . Japan and China are the only countries in which favirapir is produc ed and approved as a medical compound. Some Chinese pharmaceutical companies assure that export rights are still granted via international diplomatic means by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).[ci1a1io11 neeite,t]

Medical authorities in China hav	aid a drug used in Japan to treat new strain  of influenza appeared to be effective in coronavi ru   patient  , Japane e media  aid on Wedne day.

Zhang Xi nm in, an official at China '	cienc  and technology mini try , aid favipiravir
dev  loped by a  ub idiary of Fujifilm, had produced encouraging outcome  in clinical trial  m Wuhan and Shenzhen involving 340 patients.

"It has a high degr  e of safety and i  clearly effective in treatment,   Zhang told reporter s on Tue day.

Pati  nt  who w r  given th   medicine in Shenzhen turned negative for the virn  aft r a m edian of four day  after b coming po itive, compared with a median of 11 day  for those who were not treated with the drug, public broadcaster	HK   aid.

In addition, X-ray   confirmed improvement   in lung condition in about 91% of the patient   who w  re treated with favipiravir , compared to 62% or tho e without th   drug.

Coronavirus: the week explained - our expert correspondents  put a week's worth developments in context  in one email newsletter
Fujifilm Toyama Chemical   which developed the drug - al  o known a   Avigan - in 20 L4  has
declined to comment on the claim .

 hare  in the firm  urged on W dn	day following Zhang'   comm  nt , clo ing the morning up 14.7% at 5,207 y  n , having bri  fly hit their daily limit bigb of 5,238 y  n.

Doctors in Japan are u  ing the same dmg in clinical studies on coronavims patients with mild to moderate   ymptom  , hoping it will prevent the virus from multiplying in patient  .

But a Japane e health mini try  ource  ugge ted the drug wa  not a  effective in people with more severe symptoms. "We've given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn't seem to work that well when the viru s has already multiplied," the source told the Mainichi Sbimbun.

The same limitations had been identified in  tudie s involving coronaviru   patients using a combination of the HIV antiretroviral   lopinavir and ritonavir, the   ource added.

In 2016, th   Japan	e government  upplied favipiravir a  an emerg  ncy aid to counter th   Ebola
viru   outbreak in Guinea.

Favipiravir would need governm  nt approval for full- cale use on Covid-19 patients	me  it wa originally intend  d to treat flu.

A health official told the Mainichi the drug could be approved a  early a  May.  'But if the re ult of clinical r	earch are delayed  approval could al o b   delayed."

DALIAN , Ch ina -- An influenza medicine developed by a Fuj ifilm Holdings group member is effective against the nove l coronav irus, the Chinese government said Tuesday.

The government plans to officially recommend the drug's use for treatment. Fujifilm Toyoma
Chemical developed favipiravir, sold under the brand Avigan.

"It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment," said Zhang Xinmin, director of th e science mini stry's China Nationa l Center for Biotechnology  Developmen t,  in a  news conference. Fujifi lm Toyoma  Chemica l developed th e drug in 20 J 4, and  it bas been  provided  to patients in Japan  as treatment for th e novel comonavi ru s since Febru ary.

Zhejian g Hisun  Pharmaceutica l  signed  a  patent- licensing agreement  for favipiravir  with  Fujifilm in 20 l6. The drugmaker received clearance to produce the drug from Chinese authori ties in February and can ramp up output of a generic version.

The cl inical trial was conducted  at hospitals in Wnhan and Shenzhen, with 200 patients
participating. Test results for those recei ving the drug turn ed negative in a shorter period, and
their pneumonia  symptom s improved at a higher rate.

[Warning External Email]
Good morning, Howard-some answers and non-answers. As is the case for most answers, the most accurate is "it depends", but I realize that is not helpful in busy clinical settings:
No symptoms - get test positive - can you work


At this point in the pandemic, no.  While we do not know what role asymptomatic infection
may play in transmission and it is plausible that someone who is NOT coughing and sneezing (or any other respiratory droplet self-generating acts)is going to be less infectious than someone who is, persons known to be infected should self-isolate. This, of course, is particularly important for someone who has closed contact with someone at greater risk of severe illness and health care providers.



Symptoms - test negative - can you work- or do you need 2 negatives- or the test has to be done 2-3-4 days after you develop symptoms

Even before COVID-19, working while ill with a respiratory illness puts others at risk. Particularly during when flu activity is high. Not toughing it out and going into work while sick is more important now than ever and is an important component of social distancing-this is one of the founda tional ways that we distribute the impact of the pandemic over as long of a period as possible. (We are all getting good a drawing the two pandemic curves in the air on imaginary x­ and y-axes.). One of the critica l areas where we need more data is on when someone who is infected becomes test-positive. Presumably, test-positivity would correlate with vira l load in the respiratory tract and a+ would indicate greater likelihood of infectiousness. But the real challenge of the return-to-work issue lies in your next question:

Test positive - back to work when -do you need negative tests- or just time - ? 2 weeks after
first symptoms, first test positive.


Ah, there is the rub-currently, the recommendations vary-CDC has gone with 2 negative swabs 24 hours apart, but we do not believe that positivity during recovery necessarily proves infectiousness. This is a crucial question. We are reviewing the available data, examining at how PCR positivity, cycle threshold, and viral culture line up-the goal is to develop good,

clinical parameters to justify ending precautions, rather than requiring microbiological tests. A Get Out of Isolation Free card, if you will. The hypothesis we are testing to 2 weeks after onset and >72 hours without symptoms.  Currently the published recommendations are not satisfying:

https ://www.c dc .gov/co ronavirus/20 19-nCoV/ la b/guidelines-c linica 1-s pecimens. htmI


I may have more information on this topic later today.


Finally, in all complex epidemics, there is a tendency to search for a silver bullet-that one thing that will solve all of our problems. When an intervention is in short supply, the bullet turns platinum-"if only we could do x, the problem would be solved". This was vaccine in 2009  HlNl, naloxone in the opioid crisis, and now testing in coronavirus.  Increased access to testing is desperately needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is going to take a scientifically and wholistic and systemic approach to mitigate the impact. You have nicely outlined some of the "next questions" that are raised when testing is more widely available.
More to follow. Best regards,
Jay

Jay/Tony


Some very complicated questions around testing have come up and will only increase.


No symptoms - get test positive - can you work


Symptoms - test negative - can you work - or do you need 2 negatives - or the test has to be done 2-3- 4 days after you develop symptoms

Test positive - back to work when - do you need negative tests - or just time - ? 2 weeks after first symptoms, first test positive.


As tests become more widely available this will be devil folks.

Any ideas who can write about this.


Jay - does CDC have specific recommendations.

(6 .


Dr. Fauci,

Iapologize in advance for bugging you but please read and pass along to the appropriate person, if
useful.

In the coming weeks, an antibody test for COVID-19 should be available (I suspect). As 'survivors' are identified in the general population and are determined to be largely 'immune' to COVID-19, Ithink those people should be given the opportunity to administer testing to others in the general population. The employment of VOLUNTEER survivors in the administration of tests would allow immune individuals to quickly learn how to collect samples and deal with potential infected patients face-to-face without fear of jeopardizing their own health or the health of the communities in which they live. This would free up highly trained nurses and doctors from testing and have an exponential benefit as survivors administer tests for infection and tests for antibodies and, thus, identify additional survivors. This would support more aggressive testing to bring about the eventual end of this virus when we try to identify every last infected individual who needs to be quarantined .

Note: Iunderstand we haven't yet determined whether survivors can be re-infected.  So early volunteers may be subjected to further sickness.  But the rate of re-infection should be less as a percentage than the rate of infection among the general population.  And re-infection would likely be less severe.

Note2: Creating a VOLUNTARY REIGSTRY of survivors (those with sufficient antibodies) may have a secondary benefit to businesses. It would allow businesses to quickly hire employees who could come in contact with the general public (thinking of current food delivery, grocery stores, daycare...and later...teachers, anyone in the medical or dental field, other retail businesses).

Ido understand my recommendations would generate HIPAA concerns but these are extraordinary times
which call for out-of-the-box ideas...and this would all be voluntary.

Thank you for taking a couple of minutes to read this and thank you for managing a very difficult crisis.
You and others on your team have saved a lot of lives and we are eternally grateful. Respectfully,

Dr. Fauci,
Iam a Nurse Practitioner	(b)(6) for the US Army. Ihave a recommendation as we move through this terrible time in the US as we ll as the world. To preserve the healthcare workforce why not give 25% of all health workers in the military the trial vaccine? Keep these workers away from patients until which time that the body can build immunity.Let's not expose the entire medical workforce to the COVID-19. The idea is that this 25% can take care of the population (post-vaccine) without worry of
getting ill and causing further spread of the disease .If there is possibility of the vaccine, trial age cohorts
and demographics could play a crucial part in testing. Thank you for all you are doing to protect the
health of our Nation. Respectfully,

Respiratory Protection Program Participants:


Due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak and supply chain shortage, we are temporarily suspending annua l fit tests for employees at this time. You will still be required to complete fit testing if:
 you have experienced significant physical changes likely to impact the fit of your
respirator such as:
o substantial weight loss/gain
o denta l surgery
o cosmetic surgery including the neck area and above
o an accident
o  a new medical diagnosis
 you are directly involved in the COVID-19 response and are expected to be in close contact with potential COVID-19 patients
 you are emergency response personnel (police, fire department, etc.) required to be on­
site throughout this pandemic

If you do not meet these criteria, you are not required to complete your fit test at this time. Please be advi sed that you will still need to complete the online training despite the suspens i on of fit testing. Regular fit testing will resume once the COVID-19 emergency has subsided.

Any questions concerning the HealthRx website should be directed toward
support@h eal thrx.com. Please visit the manufacturer's websites for details on your particular respirator model.  If you have questions about N95 respirators in general, feel free to email nihrespirator@ma il.nih.gov. Thank you for your efforts and consideration during this event.

Subject: Your Unprecedented Leadership and Professionalism Good morning Dr. Fausi,
Iam not one to write emails to our leaders in government as I am sure that the message doesn't get to where it always needs to go. At the risk of you possibly seeing this email, you need to know that you are doing an incredible job.

Idoubt you will be broadcasting this note but you should know that my husband and Itake great comfort in seeing you up on the podium next to our country's leadership on the COVID-19 pandemic.
You are a steady voice of reason and the right person for the job.  Even when the President doesn't get it quite right,you manage to be professional in your delivery, information and steadfast manner.  We can easily look past the President but we listen when you speak.

From the first time I heard you say on a Sunday morning talk show,."If you think we are overacting then we are probably doing the right things." I live in Maine and we are a rural state so we probably won't see the numbers that are elsewhere but we are listening and acting on your words of caution .


Ican't imagine how much pressure you are under doing your job but we need more leadership such as yours . How you choose your words so carefully without getting flustered is a gift. Ican only hope that you will continue to be the voice to get this country through this unprecedented event.

Stay healthy and keep doing what you're doing as it matters so much to this nation. Sincerely,
Karen L. Backman

defers to a diminutive, Brooklyn-accented 79-year-old doctor, Tony Fauci.
They do because, as I have learned over many years of talking with and more recently interviewing this man, he is without doubt the world's leading authority on infectious diseases. In any area of human activity or knowledge,there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard. In the world of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci.
So the American people - indeed, people around the globe - should be grateful that Tony has dug into this crisis with the same work-around-the-clock, just-the-facts ma'am style that he has used
while serving under and working with six U. S.presidents . He is as apolitical as anyone can be. I have no idea if he is registered with any political party; I suspect though that he is rabidly Independent. His only focus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment and information possible, and saving lives.
A top expert from Al DS to Ebola
Tony Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health in 1968, after completing his medical training at Weill Cornell Medical Center, and he has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984
- 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be at the top of his game. But Tony is. During this period,he has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge - malaria, Among Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply running the institute and training dozens of the world's top infectious disease professionals, has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS  and, later, leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush's direction) the President's Emergency Pl an for A I DS Relief (PEPFAR), which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and other parts of the developing world.Millions of lives have been saved by this program alone. More recently, he has been an architect and powerful advocate of President Donald Trump's pl an for ending the AIDS epidemic in the U.S.through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to disease hotspots.

In his spare time,Tony has been involved w ith writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and severa Itextbooks,and,in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire medica l profession.
For these breakthrough activit ies and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half century (he worked at NIH for 16 years before assuming his current role),Tony has received, and
earned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called the Amer ican Nobel by many) . With this long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony would let it get to his head, at least a little bit. Not the case,though.
Selfless commitment to public service
He is readily accessible to those who need treatment - he still runs a lab at NIH - or need information. Tony still lives in the same house he bought when he first moved to Washington, and it is there that he and his w ife Christine have raised their three talente d daughters (though none of them chose to attend medical school).
Until the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH by Metro, typically after running three miles for his daily exercise.And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capitol Hill, he invariably turns down a ca r and driver for the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for the obvious reasons) .
There are,of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also view their commitment to the country and its people over financial rewards. But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed Tony Fauci's long-term and selfless comm itment to this country and the health of its people.















Itried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age, to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federa l serv ice, to take some of his considerable sk ills and knowledge to the private sector . He quickly said no - money did not motivate him, serving the country did.And he stayed at NIH
- to the country's good fortune.
If there is any one medical professional who can help the country dea l with the COVID-19 crisis, it is Tony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer.
He is not a miracle worker. No one is.
But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease problems and prescribe a treatment that should,in time,provide the  requisite comfort, even if,in the short  term, the medicine is painful and inconvenient.

Subject: Possible agenda for Wednesday Hi Hilary,
I've been through the COVID-19 ideas collected from your Deputies meeting, plus reaching out for a few
other inputs. What Ihope to do is to assemble this into a lively three-hour discussion on Wednesday afternoon (2 - 5 PM). Tony is enthusiast ic about our doing this, but his presence is unfortunately doubtful, given all of the other demands he faces. I'm counting on you and Cliff to be there, however ­ is this etched on your calendars?

Please see attached for my rather rough first attempt at an agenda. It's a lot of topics and the list will probably need to be culled -	(b) (5
-Iwould want there to be time for discussion in each theme, so that other ideas could be floated.

Please let me know your thoughts, ideally this evening.  I'm also asking for input from others who are cc'd here.

Best, Francis

Donald:
 You not only got it right, but it was an extraordina rily comprehensive, informative and sobering article.  I do not agree with everything that is being done by various countries, and
you have indicated that many of these approaches are controversial.	However, your reporting
of them is accurate and well-articulated.	Bottom line is that this is an outstanding article.
Best,

Dear Dr Anthony Fauci ,

I am w riting in connection to email from Prof Robert Schwartz about possible Polish
- American collaboration in the clinical trial focus on treatment patients suffer from COVID-19

As a Polish Medical Research Agency we desire facing this pandemic with NIAID leading vaccine and therapy efforts against SARS-Cov-2.

F. Gray Handley has got in contact with the President of our Agency last week but from that time we have no further information in this pressing issue.

I will be very appreciated if we could discussed with you or your eminent staff any possibility for polish scientists to join t collaboration with NIAID to fight coronavirus for patients all of the world.

I will be personally responsible to hold this topic on behalf of Polish Medical Research Age ncy.

Thank you for your time and incredible efforts you made to global health and safety.

I remain at your disposal,

Tony --

First of a ll , thank you for al I  you  are doing to lead our country's response during this crisis.

I hesitate to reach out to you with so much on your plate, but I think this idea might help with the national response.

Inlight of the continuing challenge of engaging young people in social distancing measures, combined with the fact that so many colleges and universities are now teaching online, Georgetown's Global Health Initiative and Institute for Politics and Public Service are considering a "viitual town hall" in which you could speak directly with sh1dents at colleges and universities via Zoom (or some other platform) about the collective challenge of COVID-19 and its risk to their health and to other members of their communities.

This could be a unique forum for you, as the most trusted person in the public dialogue, to make the case directly to young people about their vital role in social distancing to flatten the curve in their communities.  \Ve would use social media, of course, to push out key segments and messages from this event more broadly.

While Georgetown would organize this "virtual town hall", we would work closely with a network of more than 30 colleges and universities with which our Institute of Politics and Public Service regularly collaborates.  We wou ld also reach out to other schools to ensure a geographic reach and a mix of public and private institutions. Of course, our team wou ld work closely with your staff to manage all logistics so as to use your scarce time as efficiently as possible.

Before we go any further in planning or thinking about this, I wanted to see if you would have
time to participate or think this is a good idea.

Best! John

Your calm approach, and real life experience being shared during the daily briefings is what everyone looking towards the USA for information needs to see.

As in anything, real knowledge, both sharing and accepting is critical to get everyone focused on overcoming the current situation .

We don't see social distancing between everyone at the news conferences, and that is disappointing, we also don't see Donald Trump acquiring the skills and abilities to truly turn over  communication and leadership to people such as yourself and your colleagues on the podium.


While that is also disappointing, it has come to be expected, therefore easy to tune
out.


Our Global world needs a Global approach of honesty and transparency, we can't afford to get this one wrong due to our normal tribal tendencies.

Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci ,

Good Morning!

I am Dr. Jamuna R. Subramaniam. I did my Ph.D from Georgetown University and postdoc in Johns Hopkins on neurodegenerative diseases. After returning to India I started working on biogenic amine neuortransmitters . One of the major trajectory of my research career was on an FDA approved, antihypertensive drug.
Given the current scenario of ACE2 being the receptor for Covid -19, and the widely used antil1ypettensive drugs also target the same. I thought of sensitizing you on a very effective antihypertensive drug, adelphane and adelphane esidrex made and sold by Novaritis This contains a historical VMAT - biogenic amines loading in synaptic vesicles, molecule , reserpine. Here, in India, a well known Nephrolog ist, has u sed this to treat a community of close to 3000 patients for almost two
decades. From him and others I have heard that it is a very effective, well tolerated antihypertensive. Reserpine is a historical molecule that it had been used in the Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda. But adelphane has the single specific pur ified molecule, reserpine, an alkaloid. Now Novaritis has stopped making it. One of the reasons being given is reserpine's negative publicity when it was used an
antipsychotic drug. The reason given was a side effect of severe depression. We did
a study on these patients on adelphane and find that it had not caused depression. Fmther, it seems to be retaining cognition in these patients. I could not publ ish these in big journals as you can understand. I am enclosing these two paper s.

As many lives are at stake, I thought I will sensitize you on this. Hope something good will come out of this. I am telling whomever I come across about the same. That is the best Ican do. Hope the current scenario will show the living daylight for reserpine and helps the humanity.



Thank you

With regards Jamuna

Dear Dr. Fauci,
I used to work in Bob Goldberg's division at the NCI (Blgd 37) from '78-'80. I'm now a

I'm including a Letter to the Editor (submitted 3.19.20) for the NEJM that proposes a cost­ effective therapy for COVID-19 . (I've included a slightly longer version with more references):

Abbrev iations: N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)


In a recent letter to Cell Research, Remdesivir and chloroquine were found to inhibit the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus activity and replication in Vero cells (1). That study was the basis for current clinical trials involving those medicines.
There might be a more cost-effective treatment for the Coronavirus. I believe
it will be sensitive to oral high dose N-acetyl Cysteine

A final common pathway to host destruction (autophagy) in infected cells in both Corona and Rota viral infections involves the Pl3K/AKT/mTOR  pathway (2,3).  This pathway is inhibited by "rapalogues" (like Rapamycin) where the

viral infection is stopped and the host cell survives. N-acetyl-cysteine, a potent anti-oxidant and glutathione precursor, alters the redox state of treated cells and can quench this same pathway (4,5). NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) has been used to rapidly clear Rotavirus diarrheal infections in children (6). Furthermore, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
(PEDV) coronavirus has been studied in Vero cells. In vitro, NAC blocks
that particular virus (7), and in vivo, NAC blocks intestinal damage caused by this virus (8). NAC likely provides a "redox clamp" on the autophagy pathway this virus exploits.

Since the PEDV coronavirus is effectively blocked in Vero cells by NAC, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) will likely also be inhibited. This test should be done, and if positive, clinical trials ought to follow.

Doses of 2.4-3.5 g/d of NAC have been used to treat patients with Lupus
(4). That dose is well tolerated and inexpensive.

If NAC were effective in symptomatic patients, it could add a cost-effective measure of protection to healthcare workers and exposed individuals.

Francis, Tony-
Mike Levitt (Nobel prize in Chemistry, 2013) sent the attached modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic to Mike Lauer. Idon't know if this will prove useful but wanted to pass it along in case.

He indicated that he was amazed to see how an Excel level analysis could allow him to predict the China epidemic would end as early at 2-Feb and get what he considers the best estimates for case fatality ratio. His first report from 2-Feb is attached as well as his most recent two-part report.

Dear Prof. Fauci,
MayIbriefly  introduce myself: My  name is Andreas Kronbichler, Iam nephrologist based in Austria, and do have an interest in renal autoimmune disease. As such, I know your landmark study about cyclophosphamide use in GPA published in 1971; and Ihave learned that you were involved inthe management of David Fajgenbaum MCD, whose story is so impressive.
I am contacting you and asking you for your help regarding a multidisciplinary FAQ
article we would like to write and which does make sense in our eyes, given the
rapid spread of this devastating infectious disease.
We would like to invite experts in the field to comment on a selected topic and then
summarize this as a paper with hopefully high impact in the field.
Ifyou agree, can you answer 1his question (around 400 words max.):
Can you describe tltepatltophysiology and some of the immu1tological aspects of
SARS-CoV-2 injection and COVID-19 disease?
I would be personally very honored to work together with you. A selection of topics
is attached to this e-mail.
With best regards ,
Andreas Kronbichler M.D. Ph.D.

Francis:
  I was just told by the VP's office that Iwill have to be at the press conference between 11:00 and 12:30 PM. And so Idefinitely cannot be at NIH physically at 1:00 PM and if the press conference starts and finishes late, I may not even be able telephone in. My guess is that it will end before 1:00 PM and so I will likely be able to phone in. Let us see how tomorrow unfolds. Regarding the session of IC Directors, this would be fine with me.
Best,
Tony


Patty:
Please let us discuss the phone in logistics if I cannot physically get there.

Subject: COVID-19 science brainstorm at NIH, and town meeting Hi Tony,
Nice Facebook session with Zuck! And Iheard you were just on CNN, but I missed that one. Idid an interview with Sheila Kaplan late this afternoon - and she greatly appreciated your message of apology. Idon't think	(b)(S  .

When we spoke yesterday, you were enthusiastic about the convening of a 2 - 3 hour session of IC Directors and SMEs from their ICs, to brainstorm about additional scientific efforts that could be mounted at NIH to address COVID-19. It looks as if this can be arranged for an early afternoon next week. Obviously there would be nothing better than to have you there in person for this. While I know your schedule is not exactly under your control, is there any 2 - 3 hour period next week that might have a chance of being open for you? If not, who would you want to be the presenter of the current portfolio of NIAID investments?	(b)(S)







We have the NIH virtual Town Meeting at 1PM tomo rrow. Is there any chance you can come to Wilson Hall in person for that?  If not, is there a chance you can ca ll in? Iwill serve as moderator, and after a few minutes of opening remarks, would hope to turn this over to you for ten minutes or so of the unique Fauci perspective.  After that, Larry and Alfred will talk for a few minutes about the NIH COVID Response Team, and Jim Gilman willtalk about what's happening at the CC. Then we'll open it up to questions, which we can accept in real time from the estimated 20,000 staff who will be logged in. But
you wouldn't need to stay for all that- if we could somehow have your participation (either in person or on the phone) from about 1:10 to 1:20, that would be really wonderful. Please let me know if that will be possible .

Sorry about the long e-mail. Get some sleep! Best, Francis

A Trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19
List of authors.

       Bin Cao, M.D., et al. Abstract Background
No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-
2 .
Methods
We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation
(Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen

(Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days,in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical
improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordina l scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.
Results
A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization;99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24;95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.90 to 1.72).

Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% Cl,-17.3 to 5.7).The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar . In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% Cl, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.
Conclusions
In hospitalized adult patients w ith severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

Hi Tony,


I could use your guidance on press interviews. I understand that only Task Force members are supposed to do television events - and I declined the NewsHour tonight to be consistent w ith that. But what is your preference for printed press pieces, when you can't do them all? Would it help the cause for me to accept some of those, or is it better to hold off? If Iwere to engage, I would certainly seek to provide answers that are 100% with what you are doing.

An example is the thread from Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times. I have declined so far -
but is this the kind of query that you would like some help with? Francis

Hi Dr. Fauci,
I'm now back in my office.	Ityped the original message on phone.	Ijust noticed a bunch of typos.	Below is a better version.



Regards, Erik


Dear Dr. Fauci,


You're beyond busy but Ihope you read this message.


(b) (4)

                                       I'm only mentioning this so you don't think I'm a paranoid freak. I'm convinced you already know the outbreak is way past the point of containment, and, unfortunately, herd immunity will soon ensue. Then, outbreak 2 will happen shortly after, and, hopefully, not ad infinitum.


I'm writing to make sure you already know or at least suspect
everythingI'm about to tell you.	Ineed to clear my conscience

because it's possible (albeit unlikely) that some of what tell you is new and possibly useful in, at least, saving lives in the USA.


I'm a physicist and have been modeling this outbreak since January.	My panic started minutes after Ilearned rvSM people left Wuhan around January 22 a few days before the CCP starting locking the country down.	The SM people  scattered to 13,000+ cities in China to visit family & friends for the Lunar Festival (Chinese New Year ).I've been communicating with quite a few people around the world including an NYU epidemiologist	CbH6J.
 . We've both been warning our families, to mostly deaf ears at first,since January.	It's been
frustrating and exhausting, but, finally, most are as prepared as possible for what's about to happen.


Ihave lots of information about China due to my business, scientific , friendship, and other ties with many there, including immunologists & virologists at top-tier institutions and laboratories . My WeChat account (like Skype I Whatapp) was
blocked by the CCP for 3 days late February / early March, but,
after a warning message, it is now unblocked . I'm willing to share with you everything Iknow, think Iknow,or seriously suspect.


Here are a few examples:


I'm confident that China stop counting dead COVID-19  infected bodies since rvJanuary 7, 2020.  They'v e been adding fabricated data daily to show (to save face) the world and their own people an impressive flattening of China outbreak curve . It's easy to prove this via data analysis because, for example, improbable coincidences occurred in much of the data. My suspi cions were eventually confirmed by at least two of my sources in China
(b)(


-----------------


. The data posted by

China is not only garbage, it has misled the world into a false
sense of security wrt death rate, age vs death, and other things; that is, if people analyzed the world's data including China, the

results are heavily biased towards nonsense, because China's number of cases accounted for the majority of cases worldwide (until a day or so ago).


Iwant to emphasize that Ido not believe China intentionally did this to harm the world.	Isincerely believe it was done for saving­ face reasons.	Saving face is possibly the most powerful motivating force in China.	it is the key to understanding how most Chinese think and why they do what they do.	China wanted the world to believe that their Herculean quarantining efforts contained the outbreak.		However, Idon't think this is true, even after spraying rvbillions of gallon of "Clorox" all the country. The number of body bags my contacts told me about about, even
after short 15-minutes walk to/from grocery stores in one city during CCP-authorized time slots, suggest the number of deaths is several orders of magnitude larger than what China's posted data indicates. Also, everyone Iknow in China continues to be in lock down (rv6+ weeks now), and several went "silent" since about a week ago . This greatly troubles me because those who went silent live in Wuhan. And, yesterday, the CCP revoked permits/license for several Foreign reporters who were trying to learn about about the situation in Wuhan and other parts of China. Several of my sources have told me, in coded language, that the situation in at least Wuhan is not under control at all. In my opinion, China is continues to be extremely concerned about saving face (first) and their economy (second). Their economy is already suffering terribly, and they can't afford to lose the many large manufacturing and other business agreements with foreign countries . This is why Ibelieve they're trying, and succeeding to convince many, to convince most of their population that the outbreak is under control, and it will soon be ok to return to work
-- even though it will not be safe, because of current outbreak
and outbreak # 2 that will likely start soon.	Citizens are not allowed to travel beyond a few stores and, in special cases, their work office, so even people who live their have no idea what's really going on especially in Hubei province including Wuhan. Also, an HlSN outbreak seems to have recently started in

humans in Hunan province (which neighbors Hubei/Wuhan area) .



Ialso have lots of information about USA. Here is some:
Ibelieve that many COVID-19 deaths were incorrectly labelled at 2019-2020 flu deaths. The spreading in the USA is almost certainly already homogeneous, because it's been going on since last year without any containment whatsoever.	Once massive testing finally starts, this truth/reality will, unfortunately, become obvious . It will manifest itself as hyper exponential (hyperbolic) growth starting a day or two after the millions of testing kits arrive and start being used. The hyper ex ponential dynamics will eventually evolve to a more accurately calibrated exponential curve once the number to tests is large enough to properly sample the population.	Idon't think Italy is ahead of us.	Ithink we're ahead and by a large amount.


A few other quick bits of info...


The time between infection and death seems to have decreased from about rv20 days (a few months) ago to possibly as short as rv8 days.	And, the incubation period seems to be significantly longer. Both, and other data I've looked at, strongly suggest at least one mutation has occurred.	This is extremely concerning to me.  Another concern is the distribution of deaths vs . age appears to not be as strongly biased, compared to when China data was included, towards older people and/or people with chronic health conditions .


Over the past 15+ years, I've traveled to China multiple times per year.	I'm pretty sure you've known this for a while, but I truly believe the outbreak tsunmai in the USA is either already happened or is about to happen.	As you know, as soon as a surge is sensed, the Tsunami will immediately follow . Ibelieve we missed the containment boat quite a while ago. I've been

closely listening to your comments on TV, and I'm pretty sure you've already come to the same conclusion but don't want to cause mass panic (I understand that).


I'm 99°/o sure that SARS-CoV-2 been spreading in the USA since late November l earl	December last vear.	(b)('1

it's possible that everyone in her office got infected too.	Who
knows how many people in Alaska got it too, but Isuspect many tens of thousands possible much more.	CbH6)


                            but it has been impossible to get tested. I've called 5 places in Alaska and none wanted me to come it for the test.


I've instructed my family and, recently (after family), close friends to get some Alvesco (ciclesonide) for emergency use only.	I've been told by colleagues on the front-line in Japan, China, and Korea, and found several pre-print papers, that it is an effective treatment for late-stage COVID-19 patients.	Some patients on ventilators who were approaching death have fully recovered after treatment with ciclesonide; ciclesonide has much smaller particles than other corticosteroids so it reaches deeper into lungs and alveolis) . Also, the treatment seems to be a potent suppressor of virus replication.	Recovered patients have tested negative shortly after the treatment.	Of course, data is limited so can't be sure the treatment is effective. However, because Alvesco has been shown to be safe for infant - 100+ year-old patients, I'm ok with my family and Ihaving it for
emergency use.  That is, only if healthcare facilities are unable to
accept them or me as a patient to treat with ventilator,

corticosteroids (or whatever the best available treatment is at that time).	Having Alvesco in our emergency kits is a much better option that someone avoidably dying because of an overburdened healthcare facility.	The other drug Ihave, and have told my family and some friends to get, is called hyroxychloriquine -- also seem to be effective and safe.	But, I think Alvesco is better because it appears to prevent the virus from replicated so infection is wiped out and no longer contagious.	Alvesco seems to be two silver bullets in one.



Idon't believe in coincidences and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but there are many things out of Iran that also concern me greatly . That's all Isay right now.



If all of this is old news to you, then Iwould greatly appreciate a response. It can be as short as "yes". Anyway, Ihad to share this information with you . Now my conscience is clear. My concern is that it's possible you don't have some of the above info, so I decided to send you this message.


Iwrote this quickly, so Iapologize in advance for any typos, etc.



Itruly appreciated your efforts, and I'm now confident that President Trump, you, and everyone else involved is doing everything possible to ensure the best possible outcomes. Iwas deeply concerned a few weeks ago, when the gravity of the situation seemed to not be fully recognized by several in DC.



Feel free to call me anytime.	My cell # is below. If you do call, I will keep anything we discuss confidential (if necessary).

 Thanks for the note. I have pushed hard on PPEs and as you may know, the POTUS has involved the Department of Defense to provide 5 million N-95 respirators.   Hopefully that will alleviate at least a portion of the PPE shortage . Regarding the bars and beaches, I have been screaming on TV 2 to 5 times per night to tell the younger generation to start taking this seriously.  I am very surprised that Gov. Desantis has not completely closed the bars, even if they serve food.  Take out only.  I will bring this up at the Task Force meeting tomorrow. Please take care of yourself.

Ihave an idea to HELP with the MASK SHORTAGE!
Please don't disregard this, as this could help our whole country!
Iknow we are concerned as a nation about a mask shortage and I have an idea to what might help.
IDon't know who to go to that can help implement this and want your input if you think this is a viable aid,then maybe you can help me reach the right people to make the biggest impact, maybe even up to the Coronavirus team in the White House.
Ihave	(b)(6) & when Ifirst heard about China quarantin ing 43 million people Igot worried about masks, I looked up how to sew a mask for myself & family. Ifound a site that talked about sewing masks for cancer treatment patients and to use 100% quilters cotton for outside & 100% flannel cotton on inside. Istarted sewing several. I know they aren't the N95, but they are better than nothing
IF needed. My Dr just told me yesterday not to go anywhere without a mask because it's too much of a risk for my health. It got me thinking. What if while people across the country were in home quarantine, ALL those who know how to sew, they sew these masks to donate in their communities.  Not for use against Coronavirus, but for other things normal masks are used (food prep, non-sickness medical reasons, etc) then they aren't using up the valuable higher rated masks that are needed for doctors, nurses & first responders fighting Coronavirus. These masks can also be washed as needed again and again which will just keep saving other masks.
During the WH Press Release this morning, Seema expresses the need for masks & Dr Birx explained
how the virus is being spread from surfaces, but that it can't survive in fabric. Which means maybe these
cloth masks will even help against the spread of the virus.
Either way, if you can help ok for these to be used in some manner vs a medical mask being used will help prolong the need for more masks and hopefully 3M can have more made by then so we never have to experience an lack of masks.
What do you think?

I'm not sure whom to contact about this, and so am writing you because I'm

However, Iwas then disheartened to learn that that hasn't been the case, at least through this past Saturday.
    (b)(	was on business in Amsterdam last week and rushed home last Thursday after hearing on Wednesday evening about President Trump's Friday midnight shutdown. He came in through LAX from Amsterdam, and wasn't asked any medical questions, nor was he asked to quarantine. Then a friend came in through Miami from Paris on Saturday, and was only given a short medical form to fill out,
and then let go. No medical check, no temperature screening, no further questions .
From touchdown to taxi (plus picking up bags), 45 minutes total.
Having lived in Singapore through SARS, I'm deeply disturbed. We had medical/temperature checks at all airports, and mandatory quarantines for anyone with possible contact with a SARS contact/patient. The virus was quickly and efficiently contained, and the same has been done in Singapore to date with Covid 19.
I was heartened last Friday as I learned that the federa l government was onboard,
and hearing about significant measures that would be taken soon. I must say I've been disheartened as of today, with not enough tests, mask, respirators and ventilators in place.And then hearing of the lack of medical screenings at airports. Please help, as I know you've so desperately been trying to do. And please help to stem any incorrect information going out from our President, information which

gives us hope for a couple of days, and then dashes that and puts many into a frenzied despair. We can cope with what's happening, and will continue to change our behavior per the guidelines, but only with information that's accurate.
Thank you, and keep safe,

Fwd: Volunteer status for current nursing students

Subject: Vol unteer status for current nursing students




Dear Dr.Anthony Fauci,

My name is Ivan Bocardo, and am a	(b)(6) U.S. Army Medic (68W) deployed to Afghanistan in 2011-2012. Ican send you my resume so you can see my skills and abilities that I can bring to the table. Am currently in nursing school ( R.N. ) in Rego Park, Queens with a
(b)(
My school (	(b) (6)) has
recieved a request from New York Governor Cuomo's office looking for nursing students to help volunteer. However many students like myself are very hesitant to volunteer for the simple fact that it will interfere with our studies and we will still have to comply with class assignments and class exams and especially with final exams this current semester coming up at the middle to end of April 2020. Yet many of my fellow classmates would love a chance to stand up and deliver help during these trying times . However our school will not except any excuses for lateness or absence even though we are now on an online learning as of this moment. So our greatest fear is that we wont finish this semester and will not be able to start next semester ( it starts April 28, 2020 for our schoo )... basically 2 semesters wasted and it will push back our graduation date and furthermore incur more student loans in order to continue with school.

This is why Iam writing to your office if an exception can be made and we can have OTJ ( on the job training for nursing) and recieve credit and for our current semester and possibly our next semester. Many of the students Ispeak about already have a Bachelor's degree ( I myself have
a B.S. In Biology from	(b) (   ) and many are or have worked as Nurse aides in many NYC area local hospitals with many years of excellent experience. Imagine if you are able to approve this for many nursing school students in just the New York City area and Long Island Suburbs .This would be virtually an untapped experienced workforce of
literally hundreds perhaps maybe thousands of hands on personnel ready to go to help relieve the over burdened health system workers and provide additional reinforcements due to the coronavirus. In not only my area of New York city but possibly all over the country where we can help providing help and additional assistance and reinforcements

Dr. Fauci, I am humbly asking for special permission, we all will need all the help we can get. Please consider this option as this can be a win/ win situation for not only NYC residents but for other areas of the country hit hard by this crisis. Ihave spoken to many of my fellow
classmates and they all understand the risk and would be willing to share the burden with the

extreme pressures put on the health care system at this time. Many of us including myself would be willing to work on site or what ever site you may need us the most, many us fully understand that we could potentially be away from our families for an extensive unknown period of
time which we are ready for and prepared for or possibly put our health on the line too.

I implore you to give us a chance and only ask for special permission for OTJ in order to fully finish our R.N. nursing degree.
Thank you for your time in reading this letter.
You are doing one fine heck of job in providing outstanding information and keeping the public informed

Sincerely ,

Ivan Bocardo

Have we reached a time when it might be useful to prove who is immune to Covid-19? I understand that there is an antibody test already available. If we could identify who is already immune, we could then let those people return to daily life, work safely in essential positions, and feed the economy.

I practiced internal medicine in Cleveland, Ohio for	CbH6X. Iwas amazed on a daily basis by the breakthrough that was PCR testing . Right now old­ fashioned antibody tests might make a critical difference to us.

Dr Fauci,

I hope all is well with you. I am a Dermatologist practicing in the Metropolitan Detroit area. I have done some literature searching on potential treatments for the novel coronavirus and stumbled across a few case case reports from China in 2005 at the time of the SARS outbreak. They detailed some successes in treatment of severe cases with chloroquine. I saw a more recent study showing hydroxychloroquine had better in vitro efficacy than chloroquine. Have you heard of this? Plaquenil is so innocuous, I wonder if we shouldn't just try it.

I think you are doing phenomenal work and really presenting a level, measured and realistic view of this epidemic to the world. Please keep up the great work. It is much appreciated

  The situation gets confusing.  See attached brief commentary and e-mail string.  As you can see, I was too tired to make any sense of it.  However, my deputy (Cliff Lane) notes that this paper argues the opposite, i.e. that ACE inhibitors might have a benefit and counters the argument to stop ACE inhibitor.s   Bottom line is that we really do not know what the effect will be clinically with respect to COVID-19.

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Iam writing to you because I have a question regarding Covid-19. How come you do not tell the compete truth to the American people regarding this virus? All Ihear is the bad facts about it.Why not give people some help and tell us the good facts about it? Good facts such as the number of actual patients is very small compared to the whole population, most people who get it make a full and complete recovery. Are you enjoying the senseless panic you made? Panic where people are
hoarding food/goods,stealing full shopping carts from the elderly, losing their jobs/wages, inadequate education now that schools are closed.
The number of people who will actually be sickened by the virus will be dramatically dwarfed by the
people who lose their jobs, receive a poor education despite their teachers best efforts and miss out on once in a lifetime events such as weddings, graduations,communions.
What you are doing is not right for the America n people!! You need to stop playing GOD and tell the people the complete truth!! The country and the people need to get back to our normal lives NOW !! Sincerely,

https: //www . nyti mes.com/2020/03 /l7/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks. htmI


Several years ago Imobilized quilters throughout the US and we raised more than $1.1 million for Alzheimer's Disease research. All grass roots, all volunteer. There are 7-10 million quilters in the US.

My friend and Iwould like to make a fabric face mask pattern available at no charge so that quilters, sewers, and crafters can make face masks. We understand these are nowhere near medical grade, but they would be better than nothing at all (See research cited in link above .) They would be made from fabric scraps and supplies on hand; no trips to the fabric store would be necessary.

At this time there are no masks available to the public at all. Sewing for a cause would give purpose to those of us staying home. Wearing a mask on rare occasions when we do venture outside has the benefits signaling others to step back even if the masks do not protect against transmission of the virus.


We are just two individuals wanting to help. I've been advised by an attorney that sharing this free pattern might open us up to scrutiny from regulatory agencies or possible law suits. We don't want to step on any toes, nor do we want any legal entanglements.

Could the NIH make this pattern available? Or the CDC? There are millions of sewers who would be delighted to step up and help right now. It would be great for morale,and even though it's one step up from nothing,IT IS SOMETHING. This could even be scaled beyond individuals making fabric face masks for themselves. Masks could be sewn for others.

Could we please work with you?


Thank you for your consideration ,

Dear Dr. Fauci.

Many insist on coughs as one of the requirements for self-isolation or testing for covid-19. However, l have read about instances where coughs were not experienced by those who tested positive.

Ts it possibl.e to share a Iist of covid-19 symptoms that *exclude* the patients in Cbina and perhaps France due to their fairly high number of smokers? Does coughing remain a symptom? J am concerned about the healtb of our nursing home residents, as well as the financial we ll-being of service sector workers .

Thank you,

99o/o of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says


ByTommaso Ebhardt, Chiara Remondini,and Marco Bertacche March 18, 2020,8:56 AM EDT

More than 99% of Italy's coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions, according to a study by the country's national health authority.

After deaths from the virus reached more than 2,500, with a 150% increase in the past week, health authorities have been combing through data to provide clues to help combat the spread of the disease.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government is evaluating whether to extend a nationwide lockdown beyond the beginning of April, daily La Stampa reported Wednesday. Italy has more than 31,500 confirmed cases of the illness.

Source: ISS Italy National Health Institute, March 17 sample

The new study could provide insight into why Italy's death rate, at about 8% of total infected people, is higher than in other countries.


The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country's coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or o.8% of the total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions.


More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third
suffered from heart disease.


The average age of those who've died from the virus in Italy is 79.5. As of March 17, 17people under so had died from the disease. All of Italy's victims under 40 have been males with serious existing medical conditions.


While data released Tuesday point to a slowdown in the increase of cases, ·with a 12.6% rise, a separate study shows Italy could be underestimating the real number of cases by testing only patients presenting symptoms.

According to the GIMBE Foundation, about 100,000 Italians have contracted the virus, daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported. That would bring back the country's death rate closer to the global average of about 2%.

Dear Tony,


Thank you again for contributing the fabulous year in review article to Nature reviews Immunology last year!

Given the current pandemic, we can only imagine how incredibly busy you are at the moment . At Nature Reviews Immunology we have decided that we would like to introduce an in-brief section that provides
a brief overview of the most notable/important research on SARS-CoV-2 , particularly with regards to its immunopathology and vaccine development_ To this end, we are recruiting a small number of advisors to point us in the right direction - this would involve no actual writing,just sending us references to the papers as and when they come out. Would you,or a member of your team, be willing to act as an advisor for this project, by sending us between 1-5 references for notable papers per month? We feel that particularly in this fast evolving situation, it is of paramount importance that amongst the deluge of data, scientists are guided towards the most important papers .

I look forward to hearing from you, With best regards,
Alexandra

Subject: Question about COVI0-19 Mechanism of Transmission HiTony:
Thank you for what you are doing for our country to try and limit the consequences of COVID-19. Many Americans are hanging on your every word, as they should be, and that includes me.

A question about COVID-19 mechanism of spread: The reported reproductive number from China of about 2.6 indicates a likelihood of large droplet spread as the mode of transmission from person to person. My question is - could there be a component of airborne spread (droplet nuclei) with this virus?  If super spreaders exist with COVID-19, is airborne spread possible? Knowing the answer to this question would help to inform decisions about PPE and Decontamination in settings such as Emergency Departments . If this is not already known definitively, could NIOSH and some key partners possibly study it in current quarantine settings?

Thanks, Tony . God bless you and your important work! Best, Ed

Subject: Community-Spread Covid-19 Contact Tracking Dear  Dr. Fauci:
Without success. for more than a week, I have tried to reach any techie CDC person about the problem of
community-spread Covid-19 contact tracking .

Though your workload is unimaginable. Ithought you might personally know and could provide contact
information of an appropriate CDC or NIH epidemiologist.

***Brief Summary of Concept***skip to End, if obvious***

Had Ibeen to a doctor or ER with a virulent disease. they would immediately have asked where I had been, with whom , and for what duration .With that information, epidemiologists can notify and test those contacts ... and their contacts ... before their symptoms are evidenced.

This manual contact tracking process is workload intensive, calendar-day wasting, data-poor, and inaccurate.

"Location tracking" can provide the raw data needed to identify potential contacts automatically , early , and thorough ly, from information routinely collected by network providers.

The location.at a date and time, of a vast number of anonymous cell phones,over the preceding two
weeks, would be very useful for identifying the index case and subsequent contacts of an individual.

As an illustration. the New York Times published , on 19 December 2019,"Twelve Million Phones, One Dataset, Zero Privacy" about the commercial location tracking industry:
https: //www . nytimes.com/inte ractive/2019/ 12/ 19/opinion/location-tracki nq-cell-phone. htmI

***End of Summary***

Ignoring the techie and legal details. can you suggest an appropriate contact, while Covid-19 infections in the United States are few?

Your continuing dedication , candor, and data-driven focus are refreshing and very much appreciated, Dr. Fauci.

Best,

John G. Boland

Ijust had a very interesting talk today with Wendy Ginsberg on the House committee on Oversight and Reform, with an opportunity to testify at a hearing next Wednesday {email attached).

While I am very excited for an opportunity to advocate for further funding and operational support for pandemic preparedness, Ialso recognize that this forma t may not be the right one to do so. Moreover, I may not be the right person to do so, as Ithink you, Francis, or Eric Lander would do far better than

I imagine they have already asked you to participate, and would just love any insight you might have as to whether Ishould consider doing this,and if so, how Ishould proceed. I really only would want to do so if it is a place where Ican help the larger infectious disease community and make a positive nonpolitical impact.

Richard Preston pointed me in your direction, saying you would be the right person to help me think through a potential hearing on codifying the global health security team on the National Security Council.
The hearing (as of right now in my mind) would

1. Examine the lessons learned from the Ebola and other previous outbreaks about how federal government design and operations can facilitate or hinder global health and stemming pandemics;
2. Analyze how eliminating the global health security team has put us several steps behind where
we need to be in fighting coronavirus; and
3. Argue for codifying the team and its leadership as part of the larger national security apparatus and avoid kowtowing to outbreak fatigue.

I'm hoping you might be willing to speak with me about your expertise and thoughts in this a rea. I'm definitely not the expert and I would love someone with your background to ensure I'm getting this story right - and that I have the right people at the witness stand to tell it.

Would you have time to talk today or some time very soon? We are hoping to have this hearing next week .

Dear Dr. Fauci,
My name is Jason Willick with the Wall Street Journal. Iwas wondering if you would be willing to talk to me for the WSJ weekend interview section on pandemics and the coronavirus-the US response but also the broader challenges from infectious disease . Iknow you are beyond busy, but Ithought I'd ask . Let me know if this is a possibility and I can discuss more details.

Subject: Great advice from Chinese expert

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Dr. Wenhong Zhang, has become very famous in China's war against COVID-19 because of his great excellence in anti-virus. Dr. Zhang is the Director of the Infectious Disease Department of Huashan Hospital in Shanghai. He is very good according to my observat ion all long. Another great doctor in China is Dr. Nanshan Zhong.

According to Dr . Zhang's video at https ://www.thepaper.cn / newsDetail forward 6537248, COVJD-19 can really be prevented with 3 key measures, i.e. to keep social distancing, wash hands frequently and wear mask s. I strongly su ggest American people should wear masks like Chinese, South Korean people, etc., because even China's highest leader, Mr. Jinping Xi, wears masks. If it is difficult for all the US people to do this now, I suggest working  staff in airports, supermarkets and other public  places should wear masks fustly in order to avoid crossing infection.

Further, Dr. Zhang said, if a person is still infected though he/she takes the above 3 measures carefully, the person must be infected by his/her family members. So [ propose the concentrated isolation of mild confirmed cases should be considered as I advised yesterday .

lstrongly suggest American government should learn precious experience of anti-COVID-19 from and cooperate with the mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea with an open mind. If you need any help to contact w ith Dr. Zhang, I will do what I can.

lam very confident that the US government will lead American people to win the anti-COVJD-
19 war by you and other great experts. Science, expertise and great learning are best med icines.

God bless you! God bless America, China and the whole world !

Best regard s,


Michael Liu

Dear Dr. Fauci,

My name  is Michael Liu. My family are living in        Cb)(6)  now. I have  been  following spread of COVID-19 (Corona Vims) closely because such virus is very contagious and dangerous.

If a person is mild ly sick with COVJD- 19, the CDC now suggests the person should "stay home except to get medical care", i.e. home-isolation, according  to https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus /2019-ncov/downloads / sick-with-20  l  9-nCoV-fact-sheet.pdf

However, the home isolation may result in family spread of COVID-19 in certain kinds of families, e.g., parents are infected but their kids are too young to take care of them, adults are infected but their parents are too old and tisky to look after them (if they live together), an old husband/wife  is infected  but the spouse is too vulnerable  to take care of him/her, etc. In such
scenarios, the home isolation may increase family spread and even community spread risks in the
us.

A great method to avoid home-isolation  risks is the concentrated isolation, i.e. to isolate
mild symptomatic people in a concentrated place instead of thefr homes.


The concentrated isolation can avoid the above family spread risks, provide professional medica l help to isolated people, reduce mental pressure of other family members , etc., so that it  can reduce community spread risks. Such method has been proved to be effective by China's war against  COVID-19.

The concentrated place can be a hotel , university dorm building, etc., which should be easily managed for medical surveillance.


The concentration isolation may be voluntarily chosen by relevant families at the beginning, and adjusted to apply subject to different conditions.

Hope the above advice helpful! Best regard s,
Michae l Liu

Subject: COVID19 emergency Dear Dr. Fauci,
I am a postdoc researcher working at LSU health sciences center In New Orleans. I would like to
communicate my concern about the COVID19 in the US.


I am Italian and my partner is Chinese and we have been carefully following the COVID19 spread first in China and now in Italy and Europe. Based on my scientific and personal knowledge Iam confident to say that the US is only few weeks ahead of What is happening in Italy now and this could only be stopped if strict measures will be taken in the entire country as soon as possible.

If you have the power, I ask you to please try to convince the government to apply such measures, even if this means to shut down the entire country for some weeks. I know that the economy and money interests are what often prevents to take such decision, but in this case we are talking about life and death and we cannot risk this high price.

We have a very clear example of how severe the COVID19 can be if we do not act on time and this is unfortunately my country at this time. We also have a good example, China, in which very aggressive measures have been applied and, despite some delay in their application at first, they now have reached a strong regression in the virus spread and they gradually can restart the country. China measures were to close every city borders, close working places and
every non essential activity. They asked the population to stay at home and go out only for food
and health emergencies. Ithink this is what we should do in US too.


A recent study from Italy in which they tested every person in one Italian city showed that the 50-70% of the people positive for the virus were asymptomatic. This is such an important information that tells us the only way to prevent the spread is to prevent the people from moving because we cannot really know who is caring the virus. Also, screening is important and should be ideally extended to everyone. https:!/www.repubblica.it/salute/medic ina-e­ ricerca/2020/03/16/news/coronavirus  studio ii 50-
75 dei casi a vo  sono asi ntomatici  e  molto contagi osi-251474302/


My lab is based in New Orleans where the number of COVID19 cases is now growing fast. However, there is no sign from the university or my institute to close . We are working as usual with only some mild restrictions even if we have colleagues that are at home sick, or worse, that showed up at work coughing. The city mayor applied some restrictions but the people are still celebrating events on the street. Up to today we were acknowledged that we have a presumptive positive case in the building where we live. We are doing what we can as responsible individuals but tomorrow we will go to work again not knowing if we are spreading the virus.

I thank you for reading this email and I hope my arguments are solid and accurate enough to encourage you to take action.

Best wishes, Giulia

These research papers show great antiviral promise for both Hydroxycbloroquine and Chloroquine. The
Chinese have started using them. So should we. The antiviral effects were originally discovered in Europe
during SARS, but then forgotten about as SARS was so aggressive it killed the host too quickly and died out. French Prof Raoult and others have helped the Chinese advising them to proceed in this way and tbey had the good sense to trial it.
Unlike vaccines and costly new antivirals, Hydroxych loroquine and Chloroquine are generally safe, very well tested, cheap and readily available today. They could be a real game changer. Please publish and dissemina te. Please also re-refer to the Blaylock cytokine paper to emphasize the importance of vitamin C, 03  etc.

Dear Dr. Fauci,


My name is Yiming and I am a clinical fellow in rheumatology at NIH/NIAMS. I have colleagues and fr iends working in community hospitals fighting against COVID-19 and we are deeply concerned regarding the CDC interim recommendations for COVID-19 prevention in healthcare settings saying that "facemasks are an acceptable alternative when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand" . Currently hospitals in New York City are asking their healthcare providers to wear surgical mask while treating COVID- 19

COVID-19 is highly contagious in healthcare settings with a large proportion of healthcare professionals being infected reported in early literature [1]. A recent study suggested that asymptomat ic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 which puts potentially additional threats to healthcare providers [2].

Although surgical mask can effectively prevent droplet transm ission, whether and to what degree SARS-CoV-2 can transmit through aerosol approach is still uncertain. Studies w ith 2003 SARS virus suggest a high level of concerns for aerosol transmission (3], and a recent unpublished study from MedRxiv revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has similar aerosol stability compared to SARS [4).

Healthcare professionals are our frontline force against the coronavirus emergency and we cannot afford even a slight probability of a large scale infections among healthcare workers due to insufficient personal protective equipment. We hope that accessing the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and any potential mass production program are actively being considered to protect, and ultimately, save lives for U.S. people.

Sincerely,

Hi Tony,
Thank you so much for calling me this morning, and for your terrific help last night trying to think through the issue	(b)(4).  (b)(6

Given our discussion this morning, I think it would be very helpful if the task force on coronavirus came up with a clear algorithm for addressing issues related to people having symptoms that could be from a cold, flu, or other virus - and not related to the virus that causes COVID-19.
Let's say there's a hypothetical patient with some combination of sore throat, aches and pain, low grade fever in the 99's by mouth, and cough; there's no shortness of breath. let's say they are now proactively self-quarantined at home and are in the process of
evaluation. Questions include:
1. Who,if any, of the person's contacts within the previous days should be contacted?
2. If it's only "close contacts" -those who were within 6 feet of the person for an extended period of time:
a. What's the definition of extended period of time?
b. Does any physical touching- such as a hug or handshake - immediately
mean there is significant contact?
c. How far back from the onset of the person's illness do we need to check for "close contacts?" This gets to the issue of how long before symptoms begin can asymptomatic shedding occur.
3. If no Covid-19 testing is available or the person has been told they are not sick enough for testing: how do we think about the potential risk to that person's contacts, for example, at home or work?

4. If Covid-19 testing is available: before the result is back, what is the advice for a corporation or other entity where the person being tested may have infected others through asymptomatic shedding of virus? Should the possible exposure, even if relatively "low risk", set off any protocol that deals with trying to minimize possible spread of the virus?



Thanks!
Jon

hi sir,
currently an effective vaccine for covid- 19 appears 12-16 months away. in view of rampant spread of disease , we can use the cow pox-small pox idea to minimize the disease mortality.
if general popul ation at large was purposefu lly infected witb human coronavirus strains which classically cau se mild URTI's, the chances of them getting infected or more probably getting severely ill with covid-19 would be definitely reduced. we do not need to make a vaccine of these strains - classically they cause mild, self­ limiting URTI's.
we have these resources and can do this in a ve1y short period.
think over it - time to innovate   like  Edward Jenner did.

OMB is putting a hold on sending HHS witnesses to the Hill through the end of March. This
will indefinitely postpone our budget hearing.


Thanks for your patience, Adrienne




Dear Agency Legislative Affairs Teams:

Due to the full Administration  mobilization underway, we are placing a temporary hold on sending up government witnesses who are engaged in the coronavirus response. The Executive Branch needs all of its resources directly focused on executing its day-to-day response to coronavirus. We will continue to practice "radical transparency" with Congress

and the American people, but participation in hearings cannot continue to divert resources from our response effort.

This pause is effective immediately. It is intended to last for three weeks, through the end of March, though we will reevaluate if it needs to be extended at a later date.

Importantly, as noted above, this does not only include witnesses for hearings that are explicitly focused on coronavirus, but also, to be determined on a case-by-case basis, witnesses and agencies who are playing vital roles on the Task Force or the broader Administration response, whether or not the hearing topic is coronavirus.

Therefore, please do not accept hearing invitations from Congress for hearings through March if you believe they meet the above criteria.If you already have hearings confirmed that you believe fits this criteria, please notify us immediately. You will likely have to postpone those hearings.

Four corners leadership offices have already been notified of this policy.


Please reach out to OMB if you have any questions, and we will be happy to work with you as we implement this policy.

Thank you.

From: Walter Tengelsen, Chmn. ofMACROSYSTEMS INST.

First,, allow me to thank and congratulate you for telling the government, and the
press, about our nation's
unpreparedness for the coronavirus spread.  But while we wait for Big Pharma to develop a vaccine for this
disease, there is something that could be done NOW to prevent the spread of the
virus ... and it wouldn't
cost the government anything!  Allow me to explain.

Decades ago, when I was a designer in Aerospace, and took my drawings up to the
blueprint room for copies,
lwould always notice the 'aroma' of ammonia in the room.  Inquiring abou t the
safety of this constant exposure
by the blueprinting staff I was told that there are three groups of people who don 't get colds: 1) those working
in salt mines, 2) those working in sewers, and 3) those working in blueprint rooms!
A few decades later I was
advised, by an MD, that the way to avoid colds is to keep saucers of household
ammonia in my house rooms
(and in the office rooms, if allowed), and that one would not even notice the smell
after a few days.  Since cold	·
virus transmission is by aerosol particles from the already-infected, and the dilute ammonia fumes are able to

'inactivate' them, might these ammonia fumes be able to protect us against the coronavirus?

Admittedly, too much ammonia gas can be very irritating (and even fatal, as in
WW!), but evidently people
seem to survive and thrive at the just- noticeable gas levels being reconunended here.
If there is some potential
lung damage from ammonia gas, that might be prevented by taking (freeze-dried) stinging nettles leaf, a widely
recognized lung-cleaning supplement that is recommended  by Naturopathic
Doctors . But it would seem that
the potentia l benefits of limiting the spread of the coronavirus in our entire
population far outweighs the risks
of lung damage . Since most homes already have bottles of ammonia (in their laundry area), this preventive
strategy could be implemented immediately, and would provide the public with the satisfaction of feeling
they are doing 'their part' in combatting this pandem ic . ..and protecting themselves
and their loved-ones.

NOTE: I am NOT a medical doctor, but an electronic systems engineer and scientist (who takes systems
engineering as a license to meddle in all things), but I was the first male family member  in 4 generations who
did NOT become a pharmacist or physician.   I'm emailing my (old address) CV
separately, bu t the e ----
cell phone number --	(b)(6J  still reach me as I'm	(b)(6J

return to my new home in	(b) C	(IF there's no travel restrictions in force)!
I can be reached via email
or cell phone to explain this preventive strategy further. Meanwhile , good luck on all your efforts to contain
this pandemic; the next four weeks or so will be critical!

Dear Dr. Fauci I to whom it may concern:

I am not a medical doctor but l have an idea.  I know you have every expert on earth working on this virus. I am watching the attempts to slow the transmission and "flatten the cmve."

What ifwe could reduce the fatality rate? Wouldn't that be huge and assist in
reducing the panic ?
lam hearing that hospitals are going to be short on respirators and that the vims attacks the lungs. My idea - might help people to breath more efficiently .



Summary:
Here is my idea: Doctors need to utilize methods that endurance athletes have used
in the past to increase their red blood cells in order to increase their body's
blood-oxygen carrying capaeity.




Further description:
Athletes Jike Lance Armstrong used blood doping and other ways to increase their
Erythropoietin (EPO). This was called cheating in sports. However, the results
gave him an advantage because his body could get more (V0-2 max) oxygen with a
single breath compared to others. This h elped Arm strong to become more "super human." Iagree that this should be illegal in sports. However, Ithink it would be great if a person was fighting for their life to be super human.

There are natural ways to increase your EPO and there are drugs to trick your body into producing more EPO.  One of the best natural ways is high altitude training (think Boulder, CO and Kenya marathon runners).  Also, the risks involved in increased red blood cell count obviously include stroke, blood clot, heart attack and many others. ButIthink that if monitored closely and as a last resort this method might help some people to survive this outbreak.

By: William Misner, Ph.D.

From 1996 until his retirement in 2006, Dr. Bill worked full-time as Director of Research & Development at Hammer Nutrition. Among his many accomplishments, both academically and athletically, he is an AAMA Board Certified Alternative Medicine Practitioner and the author of "What Should I Eat? A Food-Endo wed Prescription For Well Being". - Dr Bill's Full Bio




What is EPO?

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells (RBC). Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone produced in the kidneys, containing a 165-amino acids structure. Most
erythropoi etin is produced by the kidney's renal cortex, but some is also produced  in
the liver (mainly in the fetus), the brain and uterus.

Why is it important ?

Erythropoietin production is stimulated by low oxygen levels iu interstitial cells of the peritubular capillaries in the kidneys. Following its production in the kidneys, EPO travels to the bone marrow where it stimulates production of red blood cells

(RBC's) [2]. EPO increases the body's blood-oxygen carrying capacity, but only up to a point. An overabundance may compromise health and hinder blood flow dynamics with performance-limiting  implications . In the absence ofEPO, only a few RBC's are formed by the bone marrow.

Why are RBC's important?

Red blood cells carry iron-rich hemoglobin for up to 120-days, then they die. Unless there is a continual supply of Iron, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin C and Folacin, anemia and reduced oxygen carrying capacity manifests in two ways:

Low red blood cell count
Malformed red blood cells.

How can one increase their oxygen can-ying capacity?

There is a distinct difference between unethical, harmful, EPO-blood doping methods and the safe nutrition that effectively increases individual oxygen-carrying capacity . Once can improve their health and oxygen carrying capacity similar to EPO without compromising the athlete's health or integrity. EPO levels up to 48% safely improve performance in males, however beyond this level, the risk of compromised health increases . Look to dietary suggestions below regarding vitamins, minerals, proteins, and avoiding anemia to ensure oxygen car1ying capacity.

Can excess EPO can be lethal?

Yes. The margin between effective and lethal quantities ofEPO is very narrow. EPO use can be LETHAL. Many athletes seeking to derive its performance-enhancing effects have died from incorrectly-administered  EPO. Inappropriate use of
exogenous EPO can cause elevated hematocrit levels (i.e. thickened blood that is difficult to pump). Elevated EPO increases the risk of heart attack due to the increase in hematocrit.  Choosing sustainable, healthy choices is preferred.

Exogenous EPO is totally cleared from the urine within 48 hours of its
administration and is cleared from the blood within 72 hours of its administration
but its physiological effects prevail for several months).[3) A look at EPO's complex pathway further illustrates a complex physiological process below, see PATHWAYS[4]. Research followed over 7,000 middle-aged men for more than 12 years, and discovered that the risk of diabetes increases proportionate to hematocrit increase.[19)  [20]. Men with hematocrits above 48 percent have a 400% increased risk of non-insulin-dependent-diabetes  mellitus. The upper recommended  levels for  a female is slightly lower at 45%.

This nutritional intervention parallels exercise intensitys effect for increasing EPO. Nutritional and training interventions for resolving low EPO levels during iron

supplementation (only prescribed by a physician who should monitored progress) should not be permitted above a reference range of 48% in males and 45% in females. Similar research confirms this report.[21]  [22] [23]

Does exercise intensity increase EPO?

It's complicated. Roberts & Smith measured the effects of exercise-induced hypoxia on the physiological production of erythropoietin. Twenty athletes exercised for 3 min at 106-112% maximal oxygen consumption. The fitness of these athletes provides a physiological environment for increasing EPO naturally from short 3- minute all-out intervals . Estimated oxyhemoglobin saturation was measured by reflective probe pulse oximetry (Nellcor N200) and was validated against arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation by CO-oximetry in eight athletes. Serum erythropoietin concentrations, as measured u sing the INCSTAR Epo-Trac radioimmunoassay, increased significantly by 19-37% at 24 hours post-exercise in 11 participants who also had an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation < or = 91%. Decreased ferritin levels and increased reticulocyte counts were observed at 96 hours post-exercise. However, no significant changes in EPO levels were observed in nine non-desaturating
athletes and eight non-exercise controls. Good agreement was shown between arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and percent estimated oxyhaemoglobin saturation (limits of agreement= -3.9 to 3.7. They concluded that a short 3 minutes supramaximal exercise period could induce both hypoxemia and increased erythropoietin levels in well-trained individuals . The decline of a1ierial hypoxemia levels below 91% during exercise appears to be necessary for the exercise-induced elevation of serum e1ythropoietin levels. Furthermore, reflective probe pulse oximetiy was found to be a valid predictor of percent arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation during supramaximal exercise when percent estimated oxyhemoglobin saturation> or = 86%.[9]

What naturally occming, nutritional building blocks aid in EPO production?

Protein adequacy is a factor in erythropoietin (EPO) production. Inadequate protein nutrition can reduce the EPO produced. The erythroid response to Erythropoietin (EPO) is highly dependent on dietary protein adequacy and quality. The mouse spleen is an erythropoietic organ, which contains an EPO-responsive cell population that can be easily amplified by administration of the hormone. Researchers determined the effect of a protein-free diet offered freely to mice up to two days after injection of r-Hu EPO ( 1OOOmU/200 ul) on the response of the above population. Splenic cell suspensions from control and experimental mice were prepared in microwells containing 400 mU r-Hu EPO and appropriate medium. The response to EPO was evaluated in terms of 3H-thymidine uptake. The results obtained indicate that acutely induced protein resti·iction suppressed the response of the EPO-responsive splenic cell population to EPO when it was imposed on mice immediately after hormone injection, and suggest the appearance of deficient rates of differentiation of erythropoietic units by protein restriction .[11] Adequate dietary protein intake is l .4-1.7 grams/kilogram body weight per day for an endurance

athlete.

What other nutritional elements and processes  affect the natural production ofEPO and the body's oxygen carrying capacity?

Dietary Iron. To ensure oxygen carrying capacity, one should take the recommended daily value of iron. Food sources of iron are red meat, liver, and egg yolks. Most flour, bread, and cereals are iron-fortified. If the diet continues to be iron-deficient, only a physician should prescribe and supervise iron supplementation.

Calories. Calories are needed for EPO production . Calorie sufficiency (in spite of exercise expense) is required for optimal EPO-release. Iftraining is causing weight loss, then EPO loss may be occurring. In order to test the hypothesis that the early cessation of erythropoietin (Ep) production during hypobaric hypoxia is induced by lowered food intake, researchers compared the plasma Ep titer of rats after exposure
to continuous hypoxia (42.6 kPa = 7000 m altitude) for 4 days in fed or fasted rats
after exposure to discontinuous hypoxia. They found that plasma Ep was rather low after 4 days of continuous hypoxia . Their findings showed that fasting lowers the EPO-response to hypoxia in normal rats [12].

Hom1one and Glucose. EPO production also has hormonal-dependant roots complexly related to glucose metabolism, and calorie adequacy . The effect of Thyroid-T3 replacement and glucose supplementation on erythropoietin production was investigated in fasted hypoxic rats. It was found that 48 hr of fasting significantly reduced the circulating levels of thyroid hormones and the production of renal and extrarenal erythropoietin in response to hypoxia . These effects of fasting were completely abolished when the animals had free access to 25% glucose
solution as drinking water, despite their lack of protein intake. Replacement doses of
T3 (0.5 micrograms/ 100 gm per day) restored erythropoietin production in the fasted animals but also increased the response of the fed controls. To avoid the effect of endogenous T3, the experiments were repeated in thyroidectomized rats. EPO production in athyroid rats was found to be markedly decreased, with values equivalent to those found in normal fasted animals, and were not affected by fasting or glucose supplementation. Replacement  doses ofT3 increased EPO production  in all three groups, but the fasted animals needed five times as much T3 to obtain a response similar to that observed in the fed group. Glucose supplementation enhanced the effect ofT3 in the fasted animals but did not completely restore them. These results indicate that caloric deprivation is primari ly responsible for the decreased EPO production induced by fasting and that this effect is probably mediated by both a decreased level ofT3 and a decreased responsiveness to it.[13]
A calorie deficit therefore requires 500% more Thyroid Hormone (T3) to maintain EPO levels. This is a good reason for monitoring calorie intake during high training calorie expense.

Iron absorbtion. Dietary interventions significantly advance nonheme iron
absorption rate during EPO production. It is very important to include foods to

enhance nonheme iron absorption, especially when an exercise-induced iron loss is high or when no heme iron is consumed, such as in a vegetarian diet. Absorption of heme iron is very efficient; the presence of red meat increases absorption of non­ heme iron +400%. Only 1-7% of the nonheme iron in vegetable staples in rice, maize, black beans, soybeans, and wheat are absorbed consumed alone. Vitamin C improves the rate of absorption of nonheme iron from red meats. Diets that include a minimum of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily provide adequate vitamin C to boost nonheme iron absorption. Calcium, polyphenols , tannins from tea, and  phytates (a component of plant foods), rice, and grains inhibit the absorption of nonheme iron. Some of the protein found in soybeans inhibits nonheme iron absorption . Most healthy individuals maintain normal iron stores when the diet provides a wide variety of foods. However, if the diet contains large amounts of oxalates and phytates from dark green leafy vegetables and whole cereal grains the absorption of iron decreases due to binding with iron in the gut. High absorption of heme iron is further advanced by foods containing vitamin C in an acid environment found of the stomach. The recommended for daily iron intake is between 10-18 milligrams for adult males and postmenopausal females. Most endurance athletes consume too much iron . Iron is added to breads, cereals, and most packaged foods.

From a computer-generated  dietary analysis on 16 endurance athletes and 9 non­ athletes, iron intake from their reported food intake was assessed.

The results of this data is as follows:


GROUP

PERCENT DAILY IRON (RDI/RDA) MALE ENDURANCE ATHLETE 279%
FEMALE ENDURANCE  ATHLETE

193%


MALE SEDENTARY

158%


FEMALE  SEDENTARY

115%

What are some food combinations that increase the absortion of iron?

How foods are combined may affect iron absorption rate. Excess iron overdose is unhealthy and should be avoided. Common side effects of acute iron overload are gastro-intestinal pain, constipation, nausea, and heartbwn. Excess iron levels may generate a continuous low-grade infection. Foods are the best source of iron. The best food source of iron is liver and red meats. These foods contain heme iron, which is better absorbed than non-heme iron. Non-heme iron can be found in dark green, leafy vegetables (spinach, chard and kale) and whole cereal grains (bran and whole wheat bread). Include dark green, leafy vegetables and whole cereal grains in the daily diet. Oxalates and phytates found in dark green leafy vegetables and whole cereal grains decrease the absorption of iron because they bind with iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Iron fortified cereals increase iron from the diet. Anemia may develop on a meat-free diet and/or if the iron store or intake is low.

Red meat contains arachidonic acid, an EPO-precursor nutrient, but it also contains high levels of saturated fats and cholesterol suggesting a little (now and then) is good but too much will harmfully compromise cardiovascular lipid levels. Adding iron to the diet in supplemental fom1 is not recommended except under the supervision of a physician who is monitoring blood serum levels for a specific outcome. It has been shown that eating red meat 1-2 per week may contribute to providing substrates known to regenerate EPO as shown in animal research. The ability of Arachidonic Acid (AA), the bisenoic prostaglandin precursor to stimulate erythropoiesis and Erythropoietin (EP) Production in exhypoxic polycythemic mice and the programmed isolated perfused canine kidney was found to stimulate erythropoiesis when administered to exhypoxic polycythemic mice in the lowest dose tested (50 microgram/kg i.p.). Endogenously synthesized prostaglandins, their intermediates and/or other products of AA metabolism, such as prostacyclin and
prostaglandins play an important role in the control EPO production.[14]  Hematocrit levels are restored through the supplying dietary or supplemental specific substrates to support the body's natural EPO-producing mechanisms during endurance exercise stress.

SUBSTRATES THAT ASSIST EPO METABOLISM[15]

Acidophilus - 15-30 Billion Count Probiotics Coenzyme QlO - 150-300 mg daily
Garlic - 2 cloves or 2 capsules up to 3 x day
Kelp - 100-225 micrograms Vitamin B6 - 50-100 mg Vitamin B12 - 200-1,000 mcg Folic Acid - 800 mcg
Proteolytic enzymes - Bromelain & Papain
Selenium - 200 mcg
Vitamin A - 15,000 IU daily or Beta Carotene - 25,000 IU daily Vitamin B Complex - 50-100 mg
Vitamin C plus Bioflavonoids - 1-3 grams (divided dose) Vitamin E - 400 IU daily

Copper-2 mg
Zinc 40 mg daily ---->(Do not take zinc in amounts over 40 mg daily as it may
interfere with metabolism of iron and copper) More Dletary Recommendations
There is a method to improve iron uptake in the absence of oxalate or phytate rich foods previously mentioned above. Ifhematocrit, hemoglobin , or ferritin blood lab measures are low, the athlete may add 1-gram of vitamin C to a 3-4 ounce lean cut
of red meat cooked in an iron skillet one to two times each week. A complete dietary protoco l for cancer patients going through chemotherapy and radiation was
published and is applicable to over-trained endurance athletes who present low
hematocrit  levels.[16] Conclusion
In normal adults, the kidneys produce EPO, which initiates approximately 90% of natural erythropoietin production. Tissue oxygenation exposure regulates the production of erythropoietin . Less oxygen saturation in the air we inhale (either by altitude or hypoxic interval training) stimulates the kidneys to activate the chemical messengers to instruct the bone marrow to increase the production of EPO to resolve the lack of oxygen exposure. Hypoxia or Anemia stimulates the kidney production
of erythropoietin to increase production red blood cells. EPO released from the kidneys increases the rate of red blood cell division and differentiation of specific cells in the bone marrow.

Dietary deficiency of specific foods and micronutrients, hormon e imbalance, and lack of specific hypoxic training stress inhibit the endogenous (natural) production of EPO. Additionally, nutritional imbalance from caloric restriction (or exercise related expense), dehydration, fluid intoxication , excess calcium, excess inositol, excess oxalates foods, excess phytic acid from cereal grains, or a lack of hypoxic interval training all inhibit the natural production of EPO also. [17] [18],

Manipulating diet for protein and total calorie adequacy, monitoring hydration, using supplements, timing food combinations, adding weekly hypoxic exercise followed by easy or rest days all increases the release of natural EPO for healthy maximal oxygen carrying capacity. Plus, there are many ways to use diet and wellness to ensure that the body's production of red blood cells is sound and that their oxygen carrying capacity is functioning.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you very much for courageous and tireless efforts to defeat the coronavirus pandemic.

One of the statements attributed to you puzzled me.

The article
Dr. Anthony Fauci Says He Would Like a 'Dramatic' Reduction of Personal Interactions at Social Gatherings to Fight Coronavirus, by Donica Phifer, newsweek .com
March 15, 2020 02:20 PM
https://www  .newsweek.com/dr -anthonv-fauci-says-he-would-like-dramatic ­
reducti on-personal-interactions-social- 149241O '

quotes you as saying,

"I've said many times if you just leave it alone and left the virus to its own devices then it'll go way up and it'll come down naturally over a period of several weeks ," Fauci said. "Unfortunately for our colleagues in Italy, in France, and certainly in China, that's what happened."

Question: Is the implication that the virus would have stopped spreading rapidly in China even if their government had not instituted drastic measures to curtail the epidemic?

Put another way: Is it not correct that the drastic measures implemented by the Chinese government were very helpful in halting the spread of the virus in China?

From yet another angle: Is it correct that the public health measures adopted in South Korea and Taiwan have proved very effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic?

Thank you very much again for your hard work, Ma1tin

I ask you to address the explosion of concerns among the dental community in regards to COVID-19. We, the dental community, already high risk personnel, are at an even higher risk at this point and time. Many of those who do not work in the dental community are not aware of how high risk our cmTent situ ation is. For 8-12 hours a day we are creating aerosols while sitting 8- 12 inches from a persons open mouth. These aerosols contain saliva and blood droplets, along with billions of other bacteria and materials. In dentistry , saliva is considered a blood borne pathoge n.
Although OSHA requires Level 3 masks for all aerosol producing procedmes, not  all offices are complying. This DOES NOT matter anyway as we know SURGICAL MASKS DO NOT FILTER OUT TrIE COVID-19 virus. I ask that you suspend non essential dental procedures such as dental cleanings and other procedures that are non-emergent. That we triage patients and accept EMERGENCIES ONLY. We are at such a HIGH risk, not only to ourselves and our families, but a HIGH RISK to spreading this virus COMMUNITY wide . Many of us are taking extra precaut ions but screening patients, but with a up-to-14 day incubation period , that obviously does not  matter.
Please hear our plea to addrnss our concerns. The American Dental Association and the American Dental Hygienists Association has failed us.

Thank you Alicia Jewell

Hi Tony -

Per our conversation , see the attached email asking FDA to lift the EUA, which would allow CUA hospital labs to ramp up test capacity significa ntly. We have sent this letter also to Francis
and to Adam Boehler and were on a call with them.Jeff Shuren at FDA also knows, but we think
it will be important to take action quickly.
Many thanks , let me know if you need anything else from me at this time. Sincerely ,

Hi Dr. Fauci -good evening. Irepresent TytoCare, a company that built the industry's first and only all­ in-one medical device that pairs with a virtual exam, going beyond the means of audio and visual. TytoHome, an OTC and FDA approved/c leared device is meant to either synchronously or asynchronously examine a patient with capabilities to capture heart/lung/gastrointestinal sounds, ear/throat/skin exams, and temperature .

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, Tyto has experienced an influx of orders wor ldwide to support those that need to be monitored when quarantined. Iwould like to offer Tyto's assistance here in the U.S. and think through ways and opportunities that the product can make a difference.

Please see a few a couple of examples on how Tyto is making a difference below:


 Patient Quarantine/Discharge at Home
o Design: patients receive TytoHome or have it delivered for remote evaluation by infectious disease specialists
 Example: Home Admission Service w ith TytoCare
 Create & manage quarantine locations, onsite or offsite
o Setup: Patients do a self-exam with TytoClinic while a provider evaluates them from a distance
 Patient is remotely guided to fully disinfect the device and station before it's returned to staff for a second round disinfection
 Example: Nursi ng Home Tri age


Thank you for all that you do during this difficult time.


Thanks,
David

Thank you for your frank speaking about COVID-19. Icredit your willingness to stand up and speak aloud that "the emperor has no clothes" ... You have already helped so many through the current pandemic. I know you will understand my concern. But, please help me spread this message as well.

In light of public school closures ...these include children and young people from kindergarten through high school. These closures also include preschool programs (Volunta ry Pre-Kin Florida) for 4-year-olds that are part of a public elementary school.

These school closures do not apply to children whose ages range from infants through preschoo l(including VPK) receiving care and education in private, corporate, or faith-based centers. My center is one of these,and we are not closing.

This is a business decision. No kids = No money.
At what price?

We have more than 90 infants, toddlers and young children enrolled at our center, with 20-plus employees on premises throughout the day between the hours of 6:30 am and 6:00 pm. Ours is a 5-Star rated, NAEYC accredited preschool program.I have 17 three-year-old preschool children in my classroom on any given day, with 3 teachers assigned to this room. This is a high quality program.

Please explain how Iam supposed to take recommended precautions against COVID-19?

Does social distance apply only to adults? If not, please help me know how to maintain social distance of 3 feet between children and adults at arrival or departure times when Iam helping a child with separation from their primary care giver or saying goodbye at the end of the day? How do Imaintain social distance between children during center time in the block area, in the

dramatic play area, in the classroom library or computer center, during story time or music circle? Our 3 table surfaces are used for multiple activities through the day including meals­ and they seat six children at each table. Friday afternoon, Ihad 9 children sharing space and materials engaged in cooperative play for an extended period outside in a sandbox that measures S'xlO' ...you do the math. Our spacing for cots at nap time is considerably less than 3 feet.

We have no hot water in our classroom for hand washing for children or staff which is considered a safety measure. We are relentless in our efforts to teach hygiene to 3-year-old children who cough, sneeze, vomit upon (and occasionally may spit,bite or lick) each other or a staff member. we work to teach them to use a tissue instead of their hand/arm/shirt to wipe a runny nose...then throw it in the trash and wash their hands again. Believe me when Isay a determined child can sing "Happy Birthday" twice in an amazingly short time--definitely less than 20 seconds--aJI the while whipping through instructions to wash the tops, bottoms and fingers of their hands while they sing.Hand washing is monitored by 3 adults through the day to ensure it happens after each cough, sneeze, nose wipe and use of the bathroom. Hands are washed after sensory play indoors or out, before am snack, lunch, and pm snacks (and
sometimes during), and when we transit ion from outside play. At a minimum, these 17 children are taking turns washing hands (at our single sink) six times during a full day at preschool­ before we add in those runny noses, coughs or sneezes.

Avoid touching shared objects ...seriously? We work daily to teach these 3-year-olds to share materials and space. Yes, we disinfect our toys regularly and our room daily--but that stuffed animal may move from dramatic play to the reading nook and to a nap cot all in one day and may be held by a different child with each move. Our families send a blanket from home for their child to use through the week at nap time-along with a soft "sleep toy" if this is needed, to sooth their child to sleep. These items are stored in the child's open "cubby box" in the classroom through the week. Do we know how log COVID-19 "lives" on soft surfaces?

I am convinced school closures are necessary at this time to stem community spread of COVID-
19. Iunderstand the strain on multiple levels this will inevitably put on fomilies to provide care for and education of their own children for this period. But-young children can contract this virus and can spread it even though they may not demonstrate symptoms themselves. Or, what may be dismissed as allergies or "just a cold" may not be.Young children can carry this virus home to their fam ily and neighborhoods just as easily as a school age child; and, they can certainly bring it into our center from their home. How many of our children in preschool depend upon elderly family members for their care? We have infants as young as 6 weeks old and children through 5 years old at our center. How many young children in care are we willing to expose? How many and which grandparents are we going to risk?






                                                                  J Forget sporting events, museums, concerts or even worship services--! am worried about going to work on Monday...and


Again ...
This is a business decision.

No kids = No money At what price?

Hi Dr. Fauci -
I am reaching out as you have been doing an incredible job as part of the White
House Coronavirus Task Force. These are difficult times and you seem to provide the most informative interviews without sending signals of panic to the American public.

Not sure if you remember, but we were in touch years back through many executive clinical leadership searches I conducted during my 18 years at Korn Ferry. I am
now leading the hospital/health system practice for ZRG. ZRG is an innovative global boutique firm disrupting the traditional executive search industry.

As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, I am speak ing with/interv iewing many healthcare leaders (Chief Medical Officers, Hospital CEOs, Leading Scientists , etc.) as part of a thought leadership piece.
The topic is "Leading Through a Time of Crisis in Healthcare". Iknow you are
extremely busy with the task force, but Iwould very much appreciate if you have
some time for an interview/call.
As you know, strong leadership is crucial in times of crisis and we are facing weeks/months of extremely important decisions by our healthcare leaders nationwide.

Do you have any availability over the next few weeks to connect? I will make myself available to meet and/or have a video or phone call at your convenience.
Hope to hear from you soon. Regards,
Greg

can anymore after seeing the photos of the international airports today where hundreds if not thousands of people standing in line for 5-6 hours and realizing immediately the virus transmission will explode exponentially because of this. I strongly request:


1. Shut down the country NOW.  Mobility has to be as low as possible. We have to do the very best RIGHT NOW to break the transmission chain.


2. Please talk to Dr. Zhong Nanshan ($ 1¥j ill) ,the Chiense doctor and advisor during the coronavirus crisis. His advice and experience would be of tremendous value for the U.S. now.


3. Sofar, we've been acting in a reactive instead of proactive fashion. Not anymore. People need to realize that we are entering war time. We need to act fast, in light speed to beat the virus.


4.  Healthcare workers need to most strongly protected - treat it as airbo1ne if needed at the hospitals and pharmacies. Supplies of essential protective medical supplies for healthcare workers are equally important as supplies needed for the patients. Make sure supply chain from China is uninterrupted; and have American companies to start makillg masks, ventilators etc. Plan ahead.

5. Grocery store and restaurants can potentially become a hub too. They need to have high level of hygiene, and ideally no contact with the customers.


6. Garbage and belongs and bodies need to be burned.


7. Safety protocol at the labs, public and private labs that have access to the virus or experimental animals with the virus.


8. Plan ahead. Instruct patient to self-treat or be treated by family at home. Ifwe ever come to it, recruit and train volunteers ( how and whom?) to help taking care of patients.

Dr. Fauci. Clock is ticking. It's a race against time. And it's time that every single American takes responsibility. Please lead us through the crisis.

Dear Mr President ,
First, our great appreciation to you and your staff for all you do every day and in keeping our country &citizens safe. We have a family real estate appraisal business (Chicago Metro Area).Ihandle all service related items from the comfort of my home. However, my husband, William Hall, who is a Certified General Real Estate Appraise r, is out in the field all day performing interior appraisals.Ihave reached     out to all our appraisal management companies with this question to ask their lenders. Considering the abundance of caution everyone is taking and the refinance industry seeing unprecedented volume, is there any talk about lenders moving to exterior only appraisals (and possibly following up after with an interior)? We heard from ServiceLink, a Fidelity company, and they have not heard any word from their national banks/lenders changing to exterior only appraisals at this time. Thank you very much!
God Bless,

Dear Dr. Anthony s. Fauci,

It's critical to disinfect droplets , aerosols and surfaces continuously to prevent or reduce or
slow down the spread of COVID-19.

The best way is using UVC ultraviolet light UVC's wavelength is germicidal and it is capable
to inactivate coronavirus by destroying nucleic acids and

disrupting its DNA because Wavelengths between about 200nm and 300nm are strongly
absorbed by nucleic acids. The absorbed energy can result in

defects including pyrimidine dimers. These dimers can prevent replication or can prevent the expression of necessary proteins.resulting in the death or

inactivation of the coronavirus.

Fluorescent light lamps emit ultraviolet (UV) light, including UVC ultraviolet light.

Ithink it's necessary to use fluorescent tube light lamps and CFL (Compact fluorescent lamps) lamps in hospitals, Health centers, stores, supermarkets ,

elevators , public lavatory , toilets, restrooms and other public places and should always be
on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to be effective.

Research has shown that Fluorescent light lamps must be installed without any glass shade
or decorative shade and should be at least 40 watts .

I hope you find the UVC-based continuous disinfection solution helpful.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely ,

Inresearch, we have adhered to a scientific method necessary for the protection of the public in the development of new technology and treatment. There are times however when that Boyle  method  and  philosophy  should  give way  to Desca1tes approach.

The current infection bas thus far  shown  a predilection  for causing  severe illness in men more than women and in adults over 30 sparing children from mortality. lbelieve there is a reason for this and it's not becau se of past exposure to other coronovirus strains. I believe it is because of children being in the middle of or having recently completed their immunization schedule for school. These
immunizations are absol utely not providing  an immunity  to COVID-J 9, BUT, they are causing an increase in the numbers of gamma  delta t cells and NK cells. The children are responding  better to a virus w ith an 5.1 day median  incubation period because  of the higher values of gd and nk cells. Women have a better  gd and nk cell response to the flu and other viral infections which could explain why there is a gender difference in mortality. l would suggest that adults update their vaccines and especially the hep b. Interestingly , the hep viruses illicit a better gd and nk cell response and although most Western countries require hep b for health care workers, the immunizat ion rate in China is only 60% which may explain the high mortality among health  care  providers.


This has been on my mind for a few days and I felt I should share.

Thank you for your time

Ihave a question which has been troubling me since we began checking people' s

seen the temperature cutoff is 99.5F .	(b)(6

doubt vezy much that inscreening people the question is asked them whether they have taken a medicine for pa in or for fever in the last 24 hours. I am a nurse and many people do realize that the common pain relievers also relieve fevers.  Should we up our game and do better at screening?
You seem to be the wisest person on the government task force for the Coronavirus.
I hope this reaches you .

Thanks,

Dr. Fauci: Sending all students home may be increasing the spread of Covid-19 in the US because the young people now off college, middle and high school, see this as a vacation to go out and frequent social businesses, parents are taking kids out to entertain them,and they are traveling to visit friends in other cities and states, all aiding the spread of Covid-19.

Please consider more strict MANDATES TO ENFORCE TEMPORARY CLOSING OF RESTAURANTS, BARS, BOWLING ALLIES, MOVIE THEATERS, MALLS or other
places of gathering and TRAVEL ONLY IF IT IS AN EMERGENCY, to mitigate the increasing cases of Covid-19 in the US. People are clearly not taking the advice given to minimize social or public gatherings .

In order for our United States not to follow the same fate as Italy,we need mandated changes asap. Please consider telling people over 60 or 65 to also stay home from work for a 2-week period.

Thank you very much for your fine leadership in this critical matter.

Greetings Dr. Fauci,
As you know, we are currently experiencing a public health pandemic, Coronavirus (COVID-19). I am asking that you take a moment to listen to Fareed Zakaria's show that was aired today, Sunday, March 15, 2020, at (https://www.cnn.com/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps ). Please listen to the message and review the attached chart that was presented on Fareed's show. This is NOT about politics, but instead the people. Therefore, let's call to action that the United States of America government officials and leaders call for a mandate similar to other countries, such as China, Italy, and Spain (i.e., now, New York & Illinois) to help reduce the spread of this virus, flatten the curve, reduce the inundation to our healthcare system, (which is about to experience the worst morbidity and mortality outcomes), and work to save lives.
There are too many unknowns for us to continue to go on as status quo. let's be
public health officials and petition to mandate the US Administration to move to action - by putting in place a Mandatory Shutdown of Movement throughout this Country.

Currently, we have approximately (9 airports in the United States) in total chaos, which will be another wave and spread of this virus. We are not proactive; instead, we continue to react late. This is not the public health that I know and have seen throughout the duration of my public health vocation. We have to change this Pandemic, so let's get to work.
#Cry for Pubic Health Action Needed  -----****We need this Administration/Government Committee to LockDown the United States of America . This can slow down the spread of this disease, save lives, and maybe within 30 days we can get back on our feet.
Warm and sincere regards - please push action.

Dear Tony:
amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research will be postponing our Capitol Hill Briefing, "Ending the HIV/AIDS Pandemic: Lessons Learned for the Coronavirus Outbreak" planned for Thursday, March 26th, due to the declaration of a National Emergency in our country.

Once the coronavirus public health crisis abates, amfAR will reschedule the briefing and hope that you will be able to speak as planned. At that meeting, you and several other of our nation's leading health officials will address two pandemics -AIDS and COVID-19. and the lessons learned from fighting both of these diseases. We will very much look forward to hearing your perspectives about global initiatives for ending AIDS and the work done to eradicate the coronavirus pandemic . We know your remarks will help provide a roadmap for ending HIV and other infectious disease threats now and in the years ahead.
I was proud to see the contributions of the US Public Health Service highlighted in today's
WH briefing. You did an excellent job with your remarks.
Thanks for your work and dedication to safeguarding and advancing global health. Hope we
get a chance to catch up soon .

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Thank you for your leadership during the current COVID-19 crisis. We're writing to ask you to consider spearheading an additional initiative in this effort.

As you know, one of our greatest immediate needs is an adequate supply
of ventilato rs for use in hospitals. We will face a severe shortage of this crucial
equipment during a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. This will create a bottleneck in our ability to deliver care, a situation where we have to triage who should live and who should die.Tragica lly, we see this happening already in Italy.
This is a situation we must avoid.

So we propose to immediately help existing factories to increase production,to convert other existing factories for the production of ventilators and to build new factories to do so.
Some of this will take a long time to accomplish but this pandemic is also predicted
to be with us for a long time. We must stay ahead.

We should make an all-out effort to supply our hospitals properly and quickly . We are in
a time of war and we must make the commensurate effort now.

We believe we have the knowledge and the resources to do such a thing.

We just need the will, and the leadership.

We're writing to urge you to use your position of leadership to make this happen.

Here is a link to NPR's report on this crucial issue: https://www .nor.org/sections/health­ shots/2020/03/14/815675678/as -the-pandemic-spreads-will-there-be-enough­ ventilators

The medical professionals are the backbone in the fight against this virus outbreak. We need to prepare for the worst scenario that this outbreak can last for a few or several months. We need to protect our medical professionals first.

This telephone line can use the current available state information hotline, with expanded functions serving as a gatekeeper and triage mechanism for potential COVID-19 patients to receive guidance on where to seek help before visiting a busy clinic, an urgent care, or a hospital emergency room to minimize the chances of cross-infection and over-whelming large medical centers.
>

These clinics will serve as the secondary triage and referral centers for the aforementioned Fever/COVTD-19 hotline, plus for primary care clinics that are not equipped with adequate staff and testing tools. These clinics should have adequate staff including physicians and middle level providers, equipped with testing kits to perform COYID-19 test onsite. They should have the capacity of testing drive-through patients, securing airway for ventilation if needed before transferring severe patients to tertia1y medical facilities. They should be operated collaboratively  with  larger healthcare systems like U Iowa, Unity Point, and Mercy who are setting up their own isolated COVID-19 centers for more severe cases.
>

Tony,
Since "elderly" means different things to different people (to me, it's 10 years older than me - and I'm (b) C61hould I give a certain age after which people should voluntarily self­ isolate now?
And for underlying conditions, should I say "serious underlying conditions" or leave it
vague at "underlying medical conditions?" Ithink the more specific the better.
And, finally, I'm hearing that it's puzzling that hypertension is such a risk factor and that perhaps people on ACE inhibitors are upregulating receptors for ACE2 in the lung. Any evidence of that? If so, maybe we should switch people off ACE inhibitors for now. Thanks,
Jon

Hi Tony,

I would like to post this widely today,but want your input first. Can you please make suggestions/additions  /corrections?

Thanks so much! Jon



The World Health Organization has declared the Covid-19 outbreak to be a pandemic -- official recognition that the virus respects no borders and now affects masses of people in countries all over the world. And there is no denying the world is changing, in painful ways. We see it in financial markets, where prices are plunging -- and in supermarkets, where customers are stripping shelves bare. All driven by fear , as the number of
virus cases grows with each passing day. While we may feel powerless over this threat, we are not. There are important things we can and must do -­ and right now.

To borrow a phrase from the war on terror, the coronavirus only has to be right once to infect us. We have to be right every time to prevent it. So, every time you cough or sneeze, use a tissue or the crook of your arm. Every time you think of it, wash your hands -- as frequently as you can. Every time you can, practice "social distancing" -- stay away from others during this outbreak. Social distancing is now being enforced throughout our society. Schools are closing, sporting events of every kind are being canceled. The curtain has even come down on Broadway shows as the Great White Way goes dark.

Despite our best efforts, it's likely many of us will eventually get infected by the virus, since we have no immunity to it. If that's the case, you may ask, does it really matter when we get infected? The answer is a resounding
yes! And here's why: slowing the spread of coronavirus -- and consequently
delaying infections -- can make an enormous difference in our ability to handle the pandemic.

Take a look at this illustration . It appeared in the Economist and is based on a CDC report. The blue curve shows what happens when you do nothing. The number of infections peaks relatively quickly. This can overwhelm a healthcare system that is not prepared to handle such a huge number of patients. Emergency rooms and hospitals can become overloaded. We may see shortages of medical supplies -- including protective gear and breathing machines -- and shortages of healthcare workers, especially if many of them become infected. But look at the yellow curve. It shows what can happen when you slow the epidemic . The outbreak is stretched out. And while it may last longer,the peak number of infections is much lower, putting less stress on the healthcare system and allowing better care for each patient. It also gives scientists more time to develop new treatments and vaccines.

Is there any evidence this works? Absolutely, especially when coupled with the time-proven technique of aggressive testing to find and isolate infected people as early as possible. In China,where there has been strict quarantine and social distancing in the epicenter of the outbreak, new infections have dramatically slowed . In South Korea, where health officials cleverly used drive-through testing, we're also seeing the number of new cases slow
down. And there's a history lesson from the 1918 flu pandemic. Back then, Philadelphia held a parade attended by several hundred thousand people. Soon, every hospital bed in the city reportedly was filled with sick patients. Saint Louis, on the other hand, practiced social isolation and saw fewer cases.

So we have work to do, and it won't be easy, because it means changing the way we live our daily lives and how we interact with our neighbors.And we have to start now -- when we can make the most difference .

And here's something we need to keep in mind. We are all in this together. So even as we keep a distance from each other physically, we need to stay close emotionally. Social isolation is bad for your health! If ever there was a time to call or video chat with friends and loved ones . And don't forget to reach out to the elderly --who may be alone and afraid.

Demonstrating grace under pressure is easier said than done. But that is this doctor's prescription for getting through this.And, if we treat each other with kindness and empathy, we will.

Subject: Tools that may help you Tony,
It has been about 20 years since you and I talked about SARS and my model that David Williams at WHO
used.I didn't know if your old email still worked, so I'm using the directory listing by NIH in addition. I have some ideas to share with you about the use of tools in the current war on covid-19.

Your 'close the bars' statement is right on target with what Iwas writing when I heard you say it. It was a great illustration counterintuitive to what will work. You could have more correctly said keep the bars open only to those in their twenties and thirties. Five minutes later Mayor DeBlasio said everything is on the table including closing bars and restaurants! Below you will see me argue why there are better approaches and this total closure approach is the wrong move. Selective participation will work in our favor to blunt the curve! Total closure will not work and can work against us!

In a period of two weeks demand for medical treatment can go from 50% of hospital capacity to 200% due to disease progression and binomial expansion . You know the math and ideas,so there's no need to go into them. There is a need to closely consider how available tools are being used to mitigate an overwhelming of the health care system.Ican tell you now that what needs to be done isn't being done and that the road we are on now will at most postpone crossing the threshold of 100% capacity. It will not achieve the desired result of distributing cases over a greater time period so that being overwhelmed is avoided.

Consider the curves:


The 'without protective measures' curve is the normal distribution as modeled by the binomial
distribution. The 'with protective measures' distribution is what we want to achieve,although that would be foreign to an experimenta list. We don't want the number of cases to exceed capacity as
indicated by the horizontal dotted line. If the 'protective measures' are social distancing, school closings, entertainment/sporting cancelations, restaurant closings, and hygiene and similar uniformly applied measures, the 'with' curve should have a shape similar to the 'without' curve, just shifted to the right, unless there is some unpartitioned factor interact ion. The flattened curve WILL NOT RESULT because errors should be random and SAMENESS OF TREATMENT PRODUCES SAMENESS OF EFFECT. With UNIFORM application of measures the curve after application will still exceed a height showing the system capacity has been exceeded.


We could expect to flatten the mesokurtic 'without' curve into the platykurtic 'with' curve by systematic time staggering in the use of the protective measures and selectively applying the measures to drive toward herd immunity. As immunity builds toward HIT {Herd Immunity Threshold), there will be greater and greater slowing of infections as the linkages for transmission decrease. There are two points to consider here.

The first point is whether measures should be applied in a uniform and blanket manner .The answer is typically no when the effect is on an existing population because the curve won't flatten. There are two aspects of the application of measures to consider. Is the effect of the application defining the population or is it an effect within a defined population . In the instance of halting all air traffic to the US from China, the population is being defined and altered if influx is allowed and that would both increase the infections and population turbulence. There would be movement away from HIT. Any measure such as people influx, which moves the US away from HIT, is to be avoided.

School, restaurant, and sporting event closings need to be examined in relationship to their impact on
an existing, not an increasing population. The actions have many criteria to influence them, but from the viewpoint of keeping the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed closings that are staggered, variable, and alternating will work to increase movement toward HIT and promote flattening of the  'with'  curve.

The second point to consider is whether we can move the US toward HIT by age selective application of available measures. The answer is yes and this could provide the best tool. Susceptibility and strengths
of covid-19 infections covary with age. People less than 30 rarely have severe infections and the younger ones may not become infected. People under 40 show a low frequency of severe infection. It will be important to know if there is a large age cohort exempt from infection because that would undermine part of the result from selective application of measures or limit the sampling age because these people wouldn't develop immunity,but might contribute to delaying herd effects. If they develop immunity their contribution can be substantial and they can be kept separated from more vulnerable people until and unless it is established that there isn't a need.

Opening night clubs, sporting events, restaurants, and other places to people in their twenties and thirties will build immunities, break infection transmission links, and move toward HIT with little or no risk to the people or the rest of the herd. Have admission to the venues by existing ID, like a driver's license with age,and have agreement that they do not mingle with vulnerable older people. Leaving the bars open to people in their 20's and 30's will flatten the curve!

Good afternoon Sir,

Thank you for your continued vigilance in protecting the American people . Your wise guidance regarding a temporary national lockdown may greatly help in reducing the spread ofCOVID-19.

If this action were to occur it should be in phases:

Phase  1: Federal Quarantine. Effective Immediately until 4 MAY 2020 (or further notice) - ONLY Key and Essential federal employees of all agencies (IC included) should repo1t to work. Eve1yone else is on administrative leave. While buildings are empty, staff remaining  should conduct deep cleaning (air systems, etc.) to ensure a healthy environment when employees come back to work.

Phase 2: Federal recall: Beginning 4 MAY 2020, federal employees are called back
to work on an as-needed basis (indefinitely) depending on how the virus
trends. Excluding postal workers, that accounts for nearly 2 million full-time employees. There should be a mandatory home-quarantine so people are not out spreading the disease.



Phase 3: Mitigation and recovery. Federa l agencies need to produce mitigation
measures (crisis action plans) should something of this nature occur in the
future. Federal agencies must be ready to respond in an organized manner when a
cns1s occurs.

Throu ghout this COVID-19 event, military and law enforcement must have an increased presence to prevent mass hysteria  and mob mentality. Increased military and law enforcement presence may help enforce the home quarantine measures and preven t l ooting and other crimes that ten d to occur during crisis events.

The National messages may include the following:

The top priority is the safety and security of the people
We will make decisions based on health guidance and current conditions here and elsewhere
We will get through this together (share resources, express kindness etc.) We need to care for each other - It is vital it is to un ite around this crisis
As a Nation, we need to come together as a community to survive this international
disaster
This health crisis is challenging each of us to make sacrifices and implement
changes out of the norm .
Ultimately, this crisis is not about us. It's about our responsibility to each other.
Thank you for all you are doing during this difficult time.

Thank you, Sir, for taking the time to review this c01Tespondence .

Dear Director Fauci,
While important stores with pharmacies (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens) remain open, many elderly folks are afraid to enter due to the mixing of young and old and the increased risk of coronavirus exposure. Isuggest that these stores designate certain hours for for those 60 years of age and older. Now that stores are reducing hours to clean and restock the stores overnight, the best hours might be first thing in the morning. For ex.ample for Walmart , the hours designated for those 60 and over could be 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. This could reduce their exposure to younger people who might have the virus but who are asymptomatic (or relatively so). This same idea could be applied to grocery stores.

Subject: Covid 19 Minocycline Hi Dr. Fauci,
Pardon the intrusion into your email. I am sure you are super busy spearheading the fight against COVID-19, hence Iwill cut to the chase. If your research team is looking for ideas to manage this novel virus, perhaps you can consider adjuvant minocycline. Personally I conducted a small proof of concept study with minocycline in veterans with PTSD and am now
collaborating with the San Francisco VA for a larger and definitive study .The point Iam making
that minocycline has potential benefits beyond antibacterial .. I see that there is preliminary
evidence that it can slow down viral replication.


Anyway you are the international expert and we all THA NK YOU for all that you do!

Dear Dr. Fauci


I don't want to overburden you with a long email, so I'll try and
get to the point.


First, we have developed a gene expression system, our C1 cell line which is significantly more efficient than traditional cell lines being used by Big Phanna to manufactur e recombinant vaccines and drugs. The hyper productive Cl cells can be grown at flexible commercial scales and are proving to be the most efficient, cost effective way to produce the tens of million s of preventative vaccines and/or antibody treatments the world so desperately needs.


ln a collaboration with Sanofi, Cl cells were developed to produce recombinant proteins for use in manufacturin g a lower cost better performing influenza vaccine. After conducting a

mice trial Sanofi concluded that the use of our C 1 platform resulted in equal or better influenza protection, using a lower amount of vaccine that could be produced at 10-30 times higher productivity levels.


The Original Sanofi Presentation can be found at the following link:

Working  together  we can "Keep America  Safe" by  helping to address		the		immediate	coronavirus	outbreak,	be	better prepared	for	future	infectious	diseases,	pandemic,		and epidemic outbreaks, and leveraging this unfortunate situation to advance	biopharmaceutical		manufacturing	to	help	speed development, lower the cost and improve the performance of

biologic vaccines and drugs such as insulin, seasonal flu and other	vaccines and antibodies to make healthcare more accessible and affordable to patients.


 I am confident that a meeting with you can be very productive in further stimulating big pharma and other research institutions to speed effective, low cost vaccines and antibodies to market.


Given the severity of the current coronavirus situation, I am prepared to make myself available for a meeting at your converuence.




My cell number is            should you want to reach m.e quickly.

I APOLOGISE FOR SOME TYPOS IN MY PREVIOUS EMAIL SENT TO YOU OUT OF SPONTANEOUS ENTHUSIASM. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS CORRECTED VERSION INSTED.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

You may not remember but we have met years back when Iwas at Stanford University and Training with the late Donald E Thomas to consider cell therapy of HIV based on the use of reduced intensity, non-myeloablative conditioning in preparation for stem cell transplantation to induce tolerance and then apply cell therapy with donor lymphocytes which Ihave proposed for consideration of treatment of patients with HIV with secondary malignancy.

The purpose of this email is to try and capture your attention in order to consider a new treatment option for COVID-19 that can be applied for patients in need with evidence of disease with no delay. Whereas many companies focus on development of anti-corona vaccine, I believe the more rational approach should be to develop treatment for COVID-19 and then, if the virus will be deleted and/or the disease controlled or
modified, vaccination will result without the need for specific corona-specific
vaccination which is not yet available and by the time it may be available it may no longer be relevant.

I am serving as the Medical Director of a company in Hungary and we believe that one simple and safe experimental treatment of patients with existing viral disease may already be at hand,	CbH4

I wanted to convey an idea I had with regard to the coronavirus. It seems to me that trying to contain the virus as we are doing at present will be futile. Since the virus can be present for many days without a person having any symptoms, you would literally need to test everyone at the same time to determine who has it--an impossible task .


I have a different thought. We know that the virus is
especially dangerous for the old and/or immunosuppressed.  IMO we should be focusing all of our efforts on keeping that group from becoming infected. To do so that group should be encouraged to self-isolate, to limit their social interactions and other groups should be instructed to avoid them. Sort of a reverse-quarantine idea. All
testing would be done within those groups and all groups would also be encouraged to continue with the hygienic suggestions they've already received.


The problem right now is that the media has created a panic. Last night my wife and I went to the local Whole Foods and many of the shelves were empty and healthy younger people were wearing masks .


The message is not getting out that the virus is almost solely dangerous to the elderly and immunosuppressed. [Why aren't the demograph ics being released? That in itself could calm many people.]  With my suggestion, exposures to them would be diminished, significantly reducing the number of deaths, as well as

the potential impact on hospitals. Any person outside of that group
that was severely affected could be identified and
treated. Quarantining otherwise healthy people outside of those groups who finally demonstrate symptoms--like the NBA players--is ridiculous. They are likely to get the sniffles and have also already spread the virus. As long as they're not spreading it to the endangered group we should not worry about it.


In sum, we need to isolate the vulnerable and realize that the mortality rate for people outside of that group is likely lower than the flu.

Of course, while this occurs we are working on finding treatments and vaccines. But sending home workers who have next to no likelihood of being significantly impacted by this virus is
ridiculous. The virus hits hardest the old and infirm, two groups that
are most likely NOT to even be in the workforce!


To me, this solution is a lot simpler than what is being tried right now and is much more likely of success. To everyone besides the endangered group this virus is literally less dangerous than the
flu. There is no reason that anyone outside of the endangered group should have any concern at all and we need to make that
clear. Please let me know what you think.


Sincerely ,

PS. I am a speaking voice teacher.
Ifyour voice is tired from the constant talking , here are 2 easy suggestions:

1) a closed mouthed yawn (as one might do in a boring class) is a quick stretch and tension reliever for the entire
vocal mechanism

2) I0-20 minutes of constructive rest (on your back with knees bent and head on a book to keep it in line with your spine) will put your spine into a passive traction and give your back and neck muscles a chance to rest and release

T  know you don 't have much time for this sort of thing, but decreasing  your physical  stress wi II help your voice
tremendously and help you work even more efficiently.

Dr. Fauci ,
 Thank you so much for being the honest, clear minded medical leader that our country needs right now.  You are doing a superb job han.dling this difficult sil uation. My		(b) (6) a hospitalis t in State College, PA is on the front. lines of this impending crisis in our community (he is	(b) (6  and also works clinically for both internal medicine and pediatrics).

  I apprecia te the clear and easy to understand campaign to the genera l public to "flat1en the curve" and slow the inevitable spread so tha t we don't overwhelm the medical community's capacity to care for the seri ously ill. l suggest that to add to this campaign (especially given the serious Jack of testi ng; currently he is waiting 4-7 days for test results for hospita lized suspected covid-19 patients) that you make it clear to the American public that they should NOT go to their doctor/hospital/urgent care and instead stay at home, isolate themselves, and make a phone call to their doctor's office or some sort of dept of health hotline.

  If everyone with mild/moderate symptoms (and their immediate contacts) are bringing the virus into medical facilities, it greatly increases exposure and puts healthcare workers (and their families and communities) at unnecessary risk. We need to convey to the American public the importance of keeping our healthcare workers from falling ill (and into quarantine) so that they can treat those that absolutely need to be hospitalized.  There also should be a mandated no visitor policy for suspected/confmned patients at every point of care.

 I am interested in helping in any way lam able. Please let me know what I can do to increase awareness and spread the vital messages you are trying to convey.

Thank you for your service and sacrifice for the greater good of the American people,

Dr. Fauci,

I'm not a medical professional. I'mjust someone who is paying attention to what is going on. I'm hearing that in many cases people have died because they developed pneumonia due to coronavirus. Since there is no coronavirus vaccine and won't be for a while can pneumonia be
prevented by getting pneumonia vaccination? To me, that seems like a very logical course. Iwas
actually trying to get that vaccine but I was turned away because Ido not have any medical history showing that Ineed it and I'm not 65 yet. Could this be some way to lower the death while working on the vaccine?  Ihave sent this to a few other places/people but not sure I'm reaching the right people, so I'm hoping it will reach you or someone in your office that will read it:).
If we can not cure the virus yet,maybe we could get in front of it and prevent it from being deadly...
Just a thought. Zofia Agee

RESULTS OF A PHASE 1TRIAL OF GDA-201,  NICOTINAMIDE­ EXPANDED ALLOGENEIC NATURAL KILLER CELLS (NAM-NK) IN PATIENTS WITH  REFRACTORY  NON-HODGKIN  LYMPHOMA  (NHL) AND  MULTIPLE  MVELOMA

Background: NK cells have the capacity to kill tumor targets and potential in cancer therapy. Limitations include specificity, persistence after infusion and how to maximize NK cell activity in vivo. We report results of a Phase 1 clinical trial of GDA-201, a cellular product composed of Natural killer (NK) cells from healthy donors expanded ex-vivo with nicotinamide (NAM) and IL-15, a unique ex vivo activation strategy to induce persistence. Prior in vitro studies and pre-clinical models demonstrated that NAM-exposed NK cells exhibit augmented resistance against exhaustion and improved killing function, proliferat ion, and organ trafficking. We report safety and preliminary efficacy from a phase I trial of GDA-201 in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) NHL or MM.
Methods: Following donor apheresis, CD3-depleted mononuclear cells
were cultured for 14-16 days with NAM (5mM) and IL-15 (20ng/ml), resulting in a 40-fold increase in NK cells and increased expression of CD62L from 2.9% to 21%. GDA-201 contained 98% NK cells, and CD3 content was maintained at <0.5% (<5x1Os/kg/dose). Pts with R/R B-cell NHL or MM received cyclophosphamide (400mg/mz lV x 3d) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2 /d IV x 3d), followed by two doses of GDA-201 (Days 0 and 2) and low-dose IL-2 (6 million units sc). Pts with NHL or MM received rituximab (375 mg/m2)  or elotuzumab (10 mg/kg), respectively, x 3 weekly infusions to enhance NK cell targeting through antibody­ dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
Results: 25 pts were enrolled:11 with NHL (5 follicular, 5 diffuse large cell
lymphoma, 1 mantle cell lymphoma) and 14 with MM, in 3 cohorts of escalating GDA-201 dose; 14 pts received the maximum target dose (median 1.7 x 10s cells/kg, range 1.6-2.0 x 10s cells/kg). There were no dose limiting toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia (n=2), increased creatinine, hyponatremia, pulmonary edema; all events were transient. There were no neurotoxic events, confirmed CRS, GVHD or marrow aplasia. One patient died of E-coli sepsis.
Among 11 NHL pts, there were 7 CR and 1 PR with an overall response rate
of 72%. Median duration of response is 11 months (CR patients) and 3 months (PR patients). In MM patients, 1 patient with extramedullary disease had CR and 4 had SD with median duration 2.5 months. In our previous study using overnight activated NK cells, persistence 7 days after adoptive transfer was limited. Using GDA-201, flow cytometry confirmed

the persistence of donor NAM-NK in peripheral blood up to day 7-10 (day 7 range 2-55% donor NK cells; Figure 1), as well as enhanced in vivo proliferation (median Ki67 99%). In addition, the enhanced expression of the homing receptor CD62L correlated with trafficking to bone marrow and lymph nodes in vivo as confirmed by flow cytometry of biopsied tissues at day 4.
Conclusions: Cellular therapy using GDA- 201 with monoclonal antibodies
was safe, and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily
pre-treated pts with advanced NHL and MM. Laboratory studies show that the GDA-201 product shows better persistence. Larger phase II studies are warranted .

Thank you for all your hard work trying to deal with this horrible pandemic. Please consider ways to get UV l ight cleaning devices throughout the U.S. that they are currently using in Wuhan, China to attempt to contain this virus. Closed schools and sports venues can be cleaned with UV light while workers wear PPE and sunglasses to protect themselves. This pandemic could be seen as an opportunity to help  prevent the spread of other contagious diseases by implementing rational public policy such as UV cleaning when schools and sporting events have concluded . lt
may also help "flatten the curve" and hopefully rebuild consumer confidence so we

Thanks for your hard work on Coronavirus. What we desperately need are specific metrics (available daily to everyone) on the disease .We also need to know how to evaluate
them. When will we know if it is getting better? It is really as bad as the media would have us believe? Please set some goals a nd objectives on the metrics so we know where we are and know when we have won or lost.

Yesterday Rush Limbaugh compared this to data on the Swine Flu in 2009 (60 million cases, 275,000 hospitalizations, 12,500 deaths from you r website) and suddenly the Corona v irus doesn't sound very bad at all. Yet we have shut down the world economy and done irreparable harm to many lives. Can you ex plain this? Frankly no one even remembers the Swine Flu epidemic only 10 years ago.

Although COVID-19 is a unique event, we would have been much better prepared

Dear Tony,

You're doing a great job under terrible circumstances so I hope you hang in there. I'm
sure the President is driving you nuts at times.

l know you 're probably far too bu sy to do yet an other program with me (HarberTV.com /Fauci) but, if you can send me a couple of qu ick answers this morning, that would be great.

1. Do you think it's realistic we could have an effective vaccine for the COVID-19 virus by this Fall? My guess is it will be more like the Fall of 2021 but tell me if I might be wrong.

2. Given that we've known abou t the probability of a pandemic, why are we so poorly prepared to address it (e.g., masks, testing kits, medical staffing et cetera)? I realize most of the needs rarely occur and when they do, there are extraordinary spikes in demand for certain products and expertise but one would think there are ways to address this far better than we have.

3. Is there anything people should know that is not being emphasized?

Thanks for any response you can send, even if it's a few words. And keep up the good
work. You are greatly appreciated .

Best wishes,


Aaron

Dear Dr. Fauci
Given the gravity of the corona pandemic, my brother and I are reaching out to make you aware of product that we think could help mitigate the spread of the virus and protect health care workers as well as the public. We have already tried the usual channels to contact the White House and the emergency authorization use division at the FDA but also wanted to bring this to your attention also.


Medixair, an ultraviolet (UVc) air sterilizer with proven, well established unique patented germicidal technology to effectively and safely eradicate viruses and bacteria up to 99.9%. It is capable of delivering a log6 reduction in microbial concentration , by penetrating the nucleus of microorganisms, disrupting their DNA thus destroying the ability of the organism to reproduce; effectively rendering it harmless.


Medixair is a portable unit and can easily be installed in a variety of settings including hospitals, emergency rooms, waiting rooms, dentist offices , cruise ships and airport lounges. In both clinical trials and under in- vitro testing conditions (see attached white paper),Medixair has been demonstrated to be highly effective in protecting patients and health care workers from pathogens (e.g. MRSA, Clostridium Difficile) and also by
preventing cross  infection. Specifically, Medixair was tested and found effective for a strain of Coronavirus known as FCoV and thus COVID-19 would have the same susceptibility to eradication with UVc within a relatively short period of time (attached) .


Medixair has been on the market since 2005 and is fully CE marked to EN
standards. Currently it has been safely and effectively used in acute hospitals , dental surgeries , in UK, Malaysia, India, Israel, and Southern Africa.

Please let us know how we can help make these units available for use in the US during this critical period of time.

Kind regards,

Subject: Question from Jefferson Health NE Philadelphia Hi Dr. Fauci,
Hope all is well.


Dr. Fauci, we will be setting up COVID-19 testing facilities and I wanted to ask your opinion regarding the following:


Is it ok to expand our testing beyond the current strict testing criteria to include those with
lesser symptoms or potential exposure whom we want to rule out Covid-19?


We are concerned that while we isolate those with more severe symptoms who currently qualify for testing, the majority with lesser symptoms would be ambulatory and potentially spreading the illness to others. Plus, it is hard to get someone to isolate for 14 days without providing a diagnosis.

Just as we can test those we suspect for Influenza A, Influenza Band RSV, it would be helpful to be able to test those we suspect with Covid-19, including healthcare workers with no symptoms but with possible exposure.

Thank you for your time and your leadership for our nation's healthcare.


Be well.

Subject: Varicella vaccine -COVID-19 connection


Dr. Fauci,
Is it possible that the varicella vaccine could be playing a role in why children are not presenting with the COVID-19 virus? If the vaccine became common around 1995,we would be seeing little to no infection of children and young adults up to about 25 years old, which seems to be the case. Could something in the varicella vaccine have provided immunity to COVID-19?

Just an idea from a concerned citizen ...


Thank you for your remarkable leadership during this crisis. Sincerely,

Larry,


I have a favor to ask. Would you or a designee be willing to join a teleconference next week with our alliance members to discuss NIH's efforts to mitigate the negative impact of COVI0-19 on federally­ funded research?  We would need no more than 30 minutes of your time, and can schedule around you.  Ideally, though, we could make this happen soon (to state the obvious, everyone is feeling the need for touch points right now,and you are a wonderfully calming one for our university members I).

We could arrange the teleconference for as early as this Monday,the 16th: if there is a 30-minute window for you or a designee between 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm on that day or within that same block of time Tuesday, the 1J1h, we'll commandeer it!

Thank you, Larry, for considering this ask. I'm sure it comes amidst many others.


Iwould love to close by saying something insightful about the indescribable times we were in, but all I can come up with is "indescribable ."

My Best, Mary

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I am medical director of a charity clinic in Nap les, Florida.  Although we try to screen pts for cough, fever, sore throat, URI sxs, dyspnea or unusual fatigue, apparently some patients are asymptomat ic and neg for these 5 hallmarks but still contagious. There is conflict between what our Florida  governor  states and what CDC states.  Do  you believe  all of our staff should be  in goggles, mask,  gown and  gloves for AAL PATIENTS  that we treat  regardless  of not meeting one of the 5 screening criteria above.   If indeed  there  is community  spread happening,  I and many others are sitting ducks. It is not if but when!!
Thanks for any guidance you might be able to provide. Iam copying to my administrative staff  as well.
Good luck.  This is quite the challenge. Robe1t Boyd Tober, M.D., FACEP

Hi Dr. Fauci,

epiqar (https://epigar .com/) is the only system in the world that can help experienced surgeons continue to support teams of less experienced surgeons worldwide, which we're doing with Coronavirus quarantined surgeons in France & Italy now while we expand to other theaters.

For Coronavirus care we've just developed an easy plug in kit for remote hospital surgeries which US hospitals need to be made aware of before they get overwhelmed the way they are in I taly & China.
Here's an article on epiqar from today inThe Hill. Please let me know how we can help your teams. Thanks,

Tony. So good to see you now on TV in full charge. Your entire expression has changed almost like when Ibumped into you in the Washington Metro after you had gotten off the plane with President Bush.

Ihave an interesting question regarding  pneumococcal  polysacchar ide immunization. One of our staff members phoned. Her father is a physician in France and has many physician acquaintances. She was told that the doctors believe that the older patients who received pneumococcal vaccine have less of a mortality than those who did not get the vaccine.

When we did the studies and got the pneumococcal vaccine approved for the elderly in 1976 there was a battle about who should get it and whether was cost-effective. Since then, other studies have documented the benefit, especially in older people and you probably have received it. It is now routine but Iknow many elderly individuals  have not gotten immunized.	Historically, many, if not the majority of deaths from influenza in some of the past epidemics was a result of secondary infection with pneumococcus. I'm not hearing anything about urging people to get immunized with pneumococcal vaccine. The message would need to be clear so they don't confuse pneumococcal secondary infection with primary coronavirus infection. It would be a good idea for people to be urged to get the pneumococca l vaccine. If they had not received it. I'm not seeing any recommendations from the CDC or elsewhere regarding this.

Importance: High Hi Dr. Fauci,

b>_<,,



Ihave been following the news and some interviews with yourself. Iwas hoping you would be willing to speak with me about our techno logy?




Testing for the positive patients and finding a vaccine are essential, but containment is paramount.




We have the only GERM CONTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY of it's kind.




The ongoing Coronavirus and FLU viruses pose a significant threat to public health globally and here in the US.
We have the most powerful solution to minimize infection and maximize protection against SARS,
EBOLA , FLU,and all types of germs and viruses.




With local 3rd party tested efficacy of 100%, no other technology anywhere can yield this result or sustainable 24/7/365 protection.




XTI02 is a world exclusive containment technology with self-cleaning functions that can help minimize the risk of cross-contamination in hospitals, planes, public transportation, elevators, and public places.

XTI02 technology works by fonming an invisible protective layer on mostly ALL material surfaces (plastic, steel, glass, fabric , paper, walls , etc ...). It is green, sustainable, and has yielded up to 100% efficacy proven by SGS LABS (US).


I look forward to hearing from you and attached is an information file for your review.

Slr,

I appreci ate the effort of your entire team i n  ident ification and resolut i on of the
predicament the chinese government has gotten us into. That said, I believe you might add a more proactive edge by mining existing data. You're going to have to dig deep.

lt seems that the common denominator in originating vector, at least by your news releases, is plainly travel-related co-mingling of persons not otheiwise in
contact. Therefore, lwould propose that there is a great trove of existing data
wa iting to be filtered within the travel manifests' history of US-bound airlines and US-bound cruise vessels. Suggest as a start the collection of every manifest from the last 4 months or so, filtered and compared with principle contractees known to exist in the US, and list every other person on said aircraft/vessel that disembarked on US soil. DO NOT WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET SICK - Employ the Nat ional Guard and Coast Gu ard to track these folks and put a swab in their nose. 1f positive, then contact trace this smaller group. Ifnegative maintain them on the list and force compliant repor ting if they develop suspected symptoms.

Iknow it would seem to be a lot of work. Howeve1·, Ipresume your are familiar with
the FRAM Oil Fllter Guy from the 1970s, where it's better to pay now than later because you're going to pay one way or another. Get a proactive jump on DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION, CONTROL. We're burning daylight.

The following is a post Ijust placed on my Facebook page:

It's a 2-step process!!!
We are seeing the ubiquitous pleas for proper hand-washing as a preventative against contracting the corona virus. BUT...Ihave observed people doing a great job of hand-washing , then picking up their dirty cell phones!! The cell phone should FIRST be wiped down using a disinfecting wipe (do NOT use sprays or household cleaning supplies ). After cleaning the phone, THEN do a proper 20 second hand-washing. Now, CARRY ON!

Knowing where the person frequented, for example, the market would be pertinent inpreventing spread of this virus.

Evening Dr. Fauci,
My name is David Craig and Iam one of the Founders of the Medsoft Group, a Analytics,Telemetry and Reporting medical platform out of Canada.We would like to offer our solution to the NIH free of charge, much like we have done with Dr. Bruce Aylward and the World Health Organization earlier today.
Our application will track, logand provide a pathway to true two-way real time communication of COVID-19 as citizens around the US report their symptoms on the ir mobile device. We are currently implementing our technology with our partners at the University of Alberta, but we would like to refocus our immediate attention in helping with the novel coronavirus.
Deployment of our application would allow the NIH to manage and understand potential clusters and outbreaks of the pandemic, taking advantage of the estimated 96% of Americans that use a smart phone to easily record a potential case, providing all stakeholders across the US with the latest information. Medsoft Group is ready to offer this immediately and without delay. With your cooperation we believe we could be up and running within a week, providing this
invaluable tool to better understanding where and what the virus is doing around the country in real time.
Please let me know if you would like to speak further. We would be happy to demonstrate our technology as well as discuss how we would put this ambitious plan into place.

Best,

                                                               After a discussion wit11 my daughter yesterday (an Asst. Ptincipal in	(b)(6) area), we theori zed that the Coronavirus May well have already been here before the close of20.l 9.  Ch ina had likely had the outbreak begin much ear lier but never acknowledged it; people traveling to China from the US could have returned and brough t the virus with them at a much earlier date. When thinking about the number of people my daughter a.nd T have known that had a bout of respiratory illness with a cough tJiat continued much longer than the typical cold, we are proposing a theory that possibly Corona made its entry here much earlier....and this new expected outbreak may well be more of a continuation and less threatening than possibly theorized at this time.  It is just a thought but I though t it was worth sharing. If true, we have already met the disease and the deaths attributed to "nom1al" flus and respiratory causes in the elderly and previou sly impaired , may liave been caused by Coronavirus.  This could be a slightly new twist and could present a slightly lower concern for a new maj or outbreak.  Ju st a thought .....

Dear Dr. Fauci

There was a paper recently showing a ketogenic diet helped tame the general flu, in
mice.

Meanwhile, there is a drink developed via DARPA and NIH (Dr Veech) that mimics the benefits of the diet. It is called a ketone ester. Even shown to block effects of nuclear bomb style radiation (LD-70 to 100% survival).

Who can I soak to about testing this drink on mice for the general flu , or even
humans with Coronavirus symptoms?

Can I send you the paper? Thank you,

Hello Anthony,

This is how the virus was created .

Intervirion Fusion. HIV-luc(ACE2) (500 ng ofp24) was mixed with 1,000 ng of p24 of HIV-gfp particles incorporating ASLV-A envelope, SARS-CoV S prote in, or
both envelopes in PBS at 4°C for 30 min to allow binding . Samples were raised to
37°C for 15min to allow for conformational rearrangements . Virions were adjusted
to the desired pH with 0.1 M citric acid. PBS, TPCK-trypsin (final concentration  10
µ.g/ml), CTSL, cathepsin B (CTSB) (final concentrations 2  1g/ml) or CTSL buffer alone was then added. Recombinant CTSL (R &D Systems) was preactivated by incubation for 15 min at I 0 µg/ml in 50 mM Mes, pH 6.0, on ice. Recombinant CTSB (R &D Systems) was preactiv ated in 25 mM Mes, 5 mM OTT, pH 5.0, for 30 min at 25°C. After a 10-min incubation at 25°C, proteolysis was halted by the addition of 300 µI of DMEMIO containing leupeptin (25 µg/ml) and STI (75 µg/ml). Virions were then incubated at 37°C for 30 min to allow membrane fusion. 100 µl of the virion mixture was added in quadruplicate to HeLa-Tva cells pretreated for I h with leupeptin (20 Lg/ml). The cells were spin-infected and incu bated at 37°C for 5 h

Subject: Prevalence of smoking, and reported mortality rates in COVID-19



To whom it may concern:

 Iassert that the frequency of clinically si gnificant disease, as well as severe disease and mortal ity of COVID- 19 is much higher in smokers, as is the case with any pulmonary infection, such as influenza, or bacterial pneumonia.

This is clearly in addition to that due to the
prevalence of elderly and immunocompromi sed patients; but smoking status overall may be a more significant risk factor for clinically significant disease.

In listening to the news med i a, smoking has not been addressed as a significant risk
factor for disease.

 J would suspect that smoking  is at least one reason  that sucb a high mortality has recently been seen in Italy, and China, and	expect that mortality rates, as well as rates of clinically significant cases, will also be increased in other populations with increased prevalences of smokers, and strongly associated with the prevalence of smoking in the given population .

 Of course, the reporting of severe disease will be modu lated by the effectiveness of the given population in containing the virus, as well as the etiective reporting of clinical disease within the communi ty, whether severe or not.

ln listening to the news media, smoking has not been addressed as a significant risk
factor for disease.Ithink that it should be addressed.

 One wonders if it could be a mod ifiable rfak factor, at least in certain patients (such as those who have not smoked for very long).


 One also wonders whether this could be another good prognostic factor for limited reported/ clinically significant cases (and thus limited perceived spread) in the United States, obviously in addition to our early, effective containment measures.

Just thought this might be helpful. Dr. Charles W. Knight, MD

Hi Dr. Anthony Fauc

I saw you on Meet the Press this weekend and you were so awesome! Very informative , calm, assuring but with the right amount of instilling the need for us all to move fo1ward with the appropriate caution for ourselves. It's extremely reassuring to have you leading and guiding u s during this time.

I'm emailing you because Iwork at Kaiser Perm anente Hospital in	(b)(6)
-· Our administration initially said if any Covid-19 patient came into the
hospital need ing emergeny care and needing to be admitted they would be given an N95 mask and put in a negative pressure room.Now they reversed that decision and said they'd be put in a regular positive pressure roornn even afterIshowed them the CDC's recommend ation for both confimed and possible Covid-19 cases needing to be placed in negative pressure rooms/AIIR .

Well tonight a possible Covid-19 patient came to the Emergency Room and had to be admitted to the ICU. The patient was given ju st a regu lar mask and put in an elevator to the ICU. Management wou ld not confirm if the patient was in a negative pressure room and wouldn't give staffN95 masks. I again showed them the CDC website hospital protocol Covid-19 recommendations but same response. And even was yelled  at by  the hospit al nursing supervisor for asking about  it.

I feel this is not safe at all for other patients , visitors and staff if the air is being recircu lated not vented outside or through a hepa filter before recircu lating back

through the hospital. I don't know what to do. Please help. The hospital main phone
number is	Cb) (6)  the Chief of the hospital is	Cb) C

I know you're extremely busy now but any help or guidance is appreciated..even if it's just to confirm that any confinned or suspected Covid-19 patient needs to be in a negative pressure room . Thanks so much!

We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause in your
sched ules. We do hope that you will agree to be our guest speaker NEXT year for our April 19-20, 2021. As soon as your schedule allows, please let us know if you would be able to s  eak at our 2021 SDDS meeting.


Please feel free to contact David Preston preston@stanford .edu or Amanda Chase chaseama@stanford.edu or myself
joewu @stanford. edu if you have any questions.


Thank you for your understanding, and we hope to see you next

Iam sorry to write that we are going to have to cancel the Fields Symposium for April 24th, but we will re-schedule when we can. As you may know, Harvard has cancelled all meetings larger than 100 (and this morning limited that to 25) through at least April 30th. We are sad to have to do this, but we need to help mitigate the spread of the virus.  Harvard even told the undergraduates today to go home this weekend and take their classes on line for maybe even the rest of the semester.

Thank you for all you are doing to keep everyone informed about the coronavir us outbreak . We are going to give you the Harvard "Veritas" award when you are next here.

Stay well. Best regards, David

Responsiveness to emerging infectious disease threats is important.  However, Iworry that increasing funding is going away from global health priorities.  It appears that the US Ending the HIV Epidemic has already diverted funding within NIH from global work to domestic.  Will the NIH response to COVID-19 only worsen funding available for global health?

Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci,
At first, I express regret if I am bothering you in your busy schedule.
    I know you care about asymptomatic infection of COVID-19. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly all over the world, especially in Iran and Italy,  and  possibly  even more widely. Asymptomatic infections and healthy carriers are possible sources for transmission. However, such sources of infection cannot be effectively identified due to the symptoms absent. The research evidence is very lacking so far.

Subject:Coronavirus test Dear Tony:
If you can find a few minutes, Iwould very much like to talk with you briefly about a new diagnostic LAMP test for coronavirus COVID-19 that we have developed here at NEB. Iattach a paper now in the MedRxiv that briefly describes the test. It has been used already in Wuhan and because of its simplicity, speed and visual output we think it would be very useful for use here in the US . We have just met with several people at Mass General Hospital and wil l be working with them for local validation here in MA. The test itself is very inexpensive, does not require any special equipment nor training of technicians . This would appear ideal for the FDA and the CDC to know about, but Ihave not so far been able to reach

either Stephen Hahn or Robert Redfield. Iwould emphasize that our goals are to help deal with the humanitarian aspects of the current problems.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I know that you are extremely busy, but I would respectfully  urge you to take 5 mins. of your time to review the information below as I believe that I have a disruptive technology that can help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

My name is John Flym1. I previously founded a startup medical equipment company that was focused within the area of orthopedics, which I ran for twelve years. I ultimately sold the company to a public competitor, DJO Global. I have worked on difforent healthcare projects, but have exclusively spent the last twenty months focused on a new medical product within. the area of infection prevention. My goal was to introduce what I believe is a disruptive product to help healthcare facilities to prevent the spread of MDRO's in order to reduce HAl's/SSFs; however ,I believe that it can also help to reduce the spread of Coronavirus.

Nick,


Following up on our conversation this weekend, I am including some information below about our Remote Patient Monitoring platform which we are making available for free to health agencies and organizations participating in the response to COVID-19 in the United States.

Remote Patient Monitoring with FollowApp is a HIPAA-Compliant system that helps health officials to diagnose, contain and treat this highly transmiss ible viral threat by enabling the effective screening of large numbers of potential patients and to triage/prioritize targeted clinical interventions including the use of test kits.

FollowApp's monitoring dashboard and patient mobile applications (iOS and Android) can be used to deliver two of the keys to an effective response plan: 1) encourage "self-quarantining" (a fundamental epidemiologic tenet) and
2) off-load exploding clinical volume threatening hospital Emergency Departments. Healthcare systems are thus
able to maintain important contact with these populations and recommend targeted escalation of care when needed, while decreasing exposure to both clinicians and other patients.

The public perception of the lethality of this global pandemic is fueling panic which, in and of itself, is creating its own logistic issues that are already beginning to overwhelm hospital Emergency Departments. The dilemma for health care systems, then, becomes a question of identifying subpopula tions at increased risk while at the same time, keeping these patients out of the hospital.

Please feel free to forward this email along with my contact information (cell	-- Iwould be happy to provide a demo to anyone who may be interested.

Thank you again,

Seema,


Attached is the Nursing Home memo with revised guidance (changes are in red/italics). This includes suggestions from Shari and Patti Meier, but they are still reviewing the full document. We sent this to the CDC this afternoon and Ijust received their feedback (while

on this call). I skimmed through their feedback and while they recommended some
changes, they did not suggest any substantive changes.


Summary of revisions:














We've also been in contact with the industry, and believe they will support the revisions .
Happy to answer any questions.

Carissimo Dr. Fauci -


Greetings from Munich, Germany! It's hard to believe so many years have passed since our time work ing avian influenza preparedness.	Ihave watched every single interview during the past few months and Icould not be more relieved to see you at the helm of this new, rapidly evolving crisis.
Iknow you have very little time, so Iwill make this quick - hopefully to be followed by a
more fulsome and proper hello.


We have a prominent American businessman (age 64) here in Munich who tested positive a little over a week ago after skiing in the Dolomites in Italy.  He has a history of respiratory illnesses, including double pneumonias and various other similar complications.	In short,he is sedated and intubated,and was placed on ECMO during the past 24 hours. The team is administering ritonavir and lopinavir, as well as broad spectrum antibiotics.

The German doctor here would like to acquire Remdesivir to have on hand if all other treatments fail.  Because it is not being tested here, he inquired whether we could access it in the States.  Would you be able to point me in the right direction for how, if even possible, we could transfer some to the Munich-based hospital here?

Thank you so much in advance.  Any other insights of course are certainly welcome. You continue to be a national treasure.  All the best - Rita

Dr. Fauci,

Twenty years  ago, I wrote the US curriculum  "The Science of HIV" and we we1e honored  to have you featured in our accompanying television broadcast, which was nominated for an Emmy (Discovery Channel) .  Years prior to that, l snagged my Masters from BO on some novel, emergent retrovirus called HIV.

Now, its time for me to do my magic and educate this new generation on COVJD-19. This is a familiar audjence (my people),  since most use the science programs I have authored for K-8 for the past 30 years!

How do I best proceed with developing materials in sync with the national needs that demystify the concepts surrounding COVID-19 ? My skillset is in education, but my background inbiology and biochem.

Truly interesting opportunity. Tony is doing a media blitz (Sean Hannity on Fox right now) but I'm sure he will check in - and I would imagine that VP Pence will turn to him to decide how to respond to Bill's phone call. Doctor-based testing capability in the US has gone up substantially in the last couple of days - after admittedly a rocky start But home testing presents a novel detection scheme . I assume from what you say that false negatives are uncommon and false positives are rare?

For Africa , this seems like a technology that ought to be deployed as soon as possible. It astounds me that there are no documented cases in East Africa yet-that defies everything we know about air traffic with China.  Providing an opportunity for low-tech testing in Addis, or Kampala, or Nairobi, or Dar es Salaam seems like a highly desirable outcome.

My two cents.


Francis

Subject:COVID-19 Dear Francis, Tony,
Iwanted to give you a heads up on a call that Bill will have with Vice President Pence tomorrow around the COVID-19 situation. As you might be aware,we have been running an influenza transmission study in Seattle for the last 2 years .This involves at-home testing for Ill-symptomatic individuals (who log-in via a web app) and collection of nasal swabs, which are then sequenced for a range of respiratory pathogens. Dan can give you more details on this study if you have questions . When the Coronavirus situation arose,we added this to the list of pathogens and hence were able to detect some of the early cases in Washington .

The CDC has been very interested in the approach and at one point we had the highest screening capacity in the US (though only 400 samples per day, so I hope this is no longer true) .At the same time, we have developed a COVID-19 at-home screening and information system with robust software that approximates what China was doing but also takes into account the opt-in requirements that are necessary in the US.

We want to propose going beyond the Seattle area- this would be gated only by availability of testing. We can deploy this ready-now system more broadly in the US. Ideally we would also do a parallel outreach to some African countries.  I'd be interested in your views and would be happy to jump on a quick call.

Dear Dr. Sierpinski,


Dr. Fauci referred your message to me and other NIAID colleagues with a request that we respond on his behalf so as to avoid further delay. We certainly sympathize with your situation, as we also are working urgently to prevent, control and manage COVID-19 in the United States .

During his visit to NIH in 2018, I was pleased to meet Minister Szumowsk iand, although I was traveling when you visited Or . Fauci last year, Iam aware that the meeting was productive and that we remain interested in encouraging further U.S.-Poland scientific collaboration. In part, as a result of that meeting, we are also very pleased to be planning an NIH and ABM-sponsored clinical research training workshop in Poland later this year .

As you are likely aware, NIAID is collaborating with a number of organizat ions to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We are expecting the first vaccine to start Phase Itrials within the next month.As vaccines move through Phase I testing, there may be opportunities to collaborate.

In addition, with NIAID as the regulatory sponsor, we have initiated a randomized, controlled clinical trialto evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral

remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. This adaptive design trialwill a llow for the addition of new treatment arms as promising new therapeut ics for COVID-19 become available. Eventually, this trial may be expanded to include internat ional sites, potentially including some that have been affiliated with our INSIGHT Network in the
past. Three sites in Poland have participated in INSIGHT trials:


Site Name: Wroclawsk ie Centrum Zdrowia (Wroclaw)
Site Leader:Brygida Knysz


Site Name: Wojewodzki Szpital Zakazny (Warsaw)
Site Leader:Andrzej Jerzy Horban


Site Name: Uniwersytecki Szpital Kliniczny (Bialystok)
Site Leader :Robert Flisiak


It might be a good idea to let any Polish sites/investigators considering participation in this trial know that ABM might have available funding to support international collaborative research, if that is the case. This may be important information as Polish scientists interact with other European scientists considering the development of a multi-site clinical trial.

In addition, there may be other opportunities for collaborative research engaging Polish Institutions with access to COVID-19 patients, particularly through the sharing of biological samples and research data .Another approach would be for interested Polish scientists to explore shared interests with U.S. colleagues who are planning to apply for COVID-19 funding in response to current Funding Opportunity Announcements in the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts. To do what we can to facilitate possible collaborations, we would
a lso welcome receiving additional information on specific COVID-19 research interests,
capabi lities and activities current in Poland.


Thank you again for reaching out to Dr. Fauci. We look forward to continuing to discuss potential areas of collaboration.

Dear Doctor Fauci,


Ihope this e-mail is finding you well and your efforts in fight against Coronavirus epidemics is giving some effects .As you know in Poland we have currently 15 cases of CoV infection and we are also fighting mostly with general society worries than epidemics. We would like also to take part in research on CoV vaccine or drug and Polish Medical Research Agency is planning to start financing some project on it as soon as possible. Both polish medical universities and institutes are fully prepared to take part in such project.
On behalf of Polish Minister of Health Prof. Lukasz Szumowski I would like to kindly ask you for some support and collaboration options with NIH in this very delicate issue. Maybe NIH can take some advisory role in our scientific project or Polish scientists may take some part in your work bilaterally.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Dr. Fauci:

I appreciated your office calling me last Thursday regarding my email concern below on the Covid 19 virus epidemic. The fact tbat China bas a larger percentage of smokers inits population may have something to do with Lhe faster spreading of the viru s there. Male smokers out number females by a huge number and are therefore dying in much higher numbers becau se of that fact.

Has anyone at CDC looked into when a person is around cigarette smokers that the particles of smoke land onto a persons clothing. That person then comes home with those smoke particles on their clothing and they can be shed when the clothes are removed from their body thus placing the possible virus laden particles back into the air at home to infect others. Just smell your clothes the next day and you can no doubt smell smoke on them . Has this case in point been looked into as a possible means of spreading the virus? Since a side eftect of the virus is the patient  developing pneumonia would giving an elderly person the Prevar  13 shot help strengthen their immune system before the virus ever strikes them?

I wish you &other virologist God Speed with finding a vaccine that will stop the
spread of this epidemic.

Hi Dr. Fauci:

I have  been a long time admirer of you in the field  of modem medicine . This question  I have relates to the current Coronavirus  circulating around the world. For many years have informed people that the ways a virus can be passed from person to person isn't always by a sneeze, cough or by touching someones face with their band s. Has anyone in you r medica l  community  thought that  if someone were smoking  and  was an infected person  that once they expel  the smoke particles into the
air that those micro smoke particles may contain viruses that were in the
respiratory system of an infected person. Everyone	mention this to don 't believe that this is possible. What are your thoughts on this matter? Ifso why hasn't the medical community warned the public about this possibility as I stay away from all establishments that allow
smoking on their premises .

Dear Dr. Fauci,


This is Manon Cox, former CEO of Protein Sciences, the developer of Flublok® .


First of all Iwould like to thank you for your realistic comments around the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Iam glad to see that not everyone is presenting a "Spanish Flu"- like scenario.

I am reaching out to you b/c Iam noticing that so many people including professionals (MD's!) appear to be thinking that people with a coronavirus infection are dying from a cytokine storm whereas my understanding is that pneumonia (whether viral or bacterial) is generally the underlying of the lung failure.

My question to you is: Do we know whether people that have previously received a pneumococcal vaccinat ion might be better protected from death after contracting a severe coronavirus infection? i.e., would it be possible that the coronavirus causes tissue damage resulting in a secondary pneumococcal infection?

I know better than anyone (after work ing over 15 years on Flublok approval) that it is not realistic to expect a coronavirus anytime soon but if we could message that a pneumococcal vaccine could be beneficial in ultimate outcome it would be good for vaccines in general as we do have pneumovax and Prevnar available.

Thank you for your consideration .

Kind regards, Manon Cox

Dear Dr. Fauci,

America magazine is the flagship effort of America Media in New York. We are a ministry of the Jesuits of the United States and Canada. America magazine may be the best known Catholic publication in the United States, publish for more than 100years .

I realize you must be supremely busy under the circumstances, but I thought Iwould ask if you could spare a few minutes for an interview in New York, over the phone or on remote via Skype for one of our internet programs to talk about the coronavirus landfall here in the United States, how the public can best respond. We would also love to hear how your faith is helping you cope personally, perhaps how your Jesuit background is assisting your decision-making in this drama.

Let me know if you think anything might be possible. Thanks,
Kevin Clarke

Dear Dr. Fauci,


I have been reading about your efforts to learn quickly about COVID-19, and subsequently educate the American public about its risks. Iwanted to say how grateful Iam for your expertise, perseverance and candor.

Updates about what Americans should do to keep safe, and understanding what may be deemed risky for personal and community health, are greatly needed in these days of information (and possibly misinformation) overload. Giving American people current information and clear, updated guidance is the best way to create grassroots, coordinated, widespread effort, while the CDC,NIH, and other government health organizations organize the tops-down approaches to regional screening, emergency care, and COVID-19 research/testing for hopeful vaccination or treatment protocols.

I'm very relieved and assured to have strong voices of reason, experience ,and merit helping 'us' navigate these murky waters. I'm grateful for your courage.

Thank you again. Kate Dickman

Dear Doctor Fauci,


I hope this e-mail is finding you well a nd your efforts in fight against Coronavirus epidemics is giving some effects. As you know in Poland we have currently 15 cases of CoV infection and we are also fighting mostly with general society worries than epidemics. We would like a lso to take part in research on CoV vaccine or drug and Polish Medical Research Agency is planning to start financing some project on it as soon as possible. Both polish medical universities and institutes are fully prepared to take part in such project.
On behalf of Polish Minister of Health Prof. Lukasz Szumowski Iwould like to kindly ask you for some support and collaboration options with NIH in this very delicate issue. Maybe NIH can take some advisory role in our scientific project or Polish scientists may take some part in your work  bilaterally.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi Francis et al, 1write to get a message to Tony, who clearly is on the COVID-19 front Jines of these days and "everywhere." At this early stage, you may agree that it is possible that contai nment and/or mitigation will not completely solve the current pandemic . Instead , effective treatment or amelioration of the worst complications is necessary.  ln this spirit, l have an idea that was spurred by a letter in Lancet last month authored by Al Benevolent (attached). Tn thi s communication they suggest that baricitinib (Oluminant ; a JAK l/2 inhibitor registered by Lilly for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), using in silico techniques. might be useful in the treatment advanced
COVID- 19pneumonia/ARDS identified . Baricitinib could possibly blunt the cytokine storm seen in the most
severely affected patients via inhibition of JAK 1/2, but also decrease viral entry in AT2 pulmonary cells and
myocardial  cells via  inhibition  of OAK  and AAKJ.  lt is has a relatively sh ort plasma  half-life  and hence could  be more  useful  than  Roche 's tocilizumab/Actemra).    Baricitinib  has a  good  safety profile  although  as a drug to treat autoimmunity  it  is formally  contraindicated  in patients with  infections, this  could  be offset  by  treatment  patients  with  anti-virals such as Gilead's remdesivir,  etc.  Perhaps  you  folks  have  already  thought  about/discussed  its use  but if not J 'd like a chance to chat about my additional  thoughts.   Thanks.   Bill

Subject: Nursing homes are ground zero for COVID19 -- and what more we can do to save lives
in the  pandemic Dear Colleague,
Two weeks ago it was clear that COVI0-19 would become a pandemic, and, sadly it has.


Now the United States is in the acceleration phase and cases, clusters, and large outbreaks will occur in many parts of the country.

Ioutline steps we can take to reduce the harms. The core concept to protect the most vulnerable. First, restrict visits to nursing homes. All of us can play a part reducing infections. Medically vulnerable people can protect themselves by reducing social contacts. I'm not sure I'd go quite as far as my good friend Bill Schaffner and say they should become semi-hermits ,but that's certainly a helpful frame of reference. Health care needs to get much safer, and ready to surge safely. And we need to stop mass gatherings, consider telework, figure out whether closing schools will help, and more.


Read what I've posted about ground zero in the COVID-19 pandemic in the US here.


I've shared on Twitter if you'd like to disseminate .


We'll all be working together to protect as many people as quickly as possible. Thank you,
Tom

Dear Dr. Fauci:

      It occtmed to me that  if viruses contain an iron atom, perhaps a form of magnetic treatment might stop or reduce the severity of the COVID-19 virus, so I investigated and found thatviruses have one atom of iron . My suggestion is that experimentation on victims of the virus be conducted, perhaps by inserting a tiny magnet into their lungs to see if it might gather up the viruses circulating in the victim.  Perhaps external application of magnetism would work as well, I'm sure your scientists will ha ve even bener approaches to solving this problem.  I'm a problem sol ver, hav ing pub l ished a book that solves many of the Earth's problems:  "Thinking Outside The Oven -- Concomitant Concepts and Synergistic Solutions  for the 21st Century" (available at Barnes & Noble and Amazon). I'm  working on a sequel and if you

Subject: Record a short interview with me for a UPenn course? Dear Dr. Fauci,
I am embarrassed to admit that I was not familiar with your name when I read the story about you in today's NY Times, but Iwas most impressed by the statement in the first sentence that you are "widely respected for [your] ability to explain science w ithout talking down to [your] audience".

I'm putting together the first offering of CLCH 300: Communicating Science, as part of the University of Pennsylvania's new online Certificate in Climate
Change. (https:Ulpsonline.sas.upenn .edu/academ ics/cert ificates/climate -change) A brief recorded conversation with you about your strategies for communicating without being patronizing would be most enlightening for my students .

The students in this course will be coming from a wide variety of backgrounds, and potentially from all over the globe. I think they would love to hear from a scientist who is so good at communicating his field of study to different audiences. And let's face it, as soon as you say "NIH" as COVI0-19 swirls around the globe, their ears will certainly perk up! I think the students would find our interview very engaging and informative.

The first run of the course will be from May 26 to July 20, 2020, but we can record the interview (online) any time, since Iknow you are already over-extended right now. I think 15 minutes would be plenty, and Iwould be happy to send you questions that Iplan to use to guide the conversat ion in advance. If a synchronous conversation is impossible given your schedule, Iwould be happy to just send you a couple of questions and ask you to use them to guide a 10-15 minute video that you record yourself.

Please let me know what you think of this, and I will send you the syllabus when it's finalized, including where our interview would fit. Then Ican begin the process of coordinating this with the Associate Director of our Online Learning Studio.

Subject: can you use a miRNA-seq assay to detect covid-19 in blood samples? Dr. Fauci, how are you sir?
Long ago, in the early 90's, Iwas a post-doctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Viral and Molecular Pathogenesis at NIH. I don't know if the same lab is still there. Now Iwork on brain injury and Alzheimer's but my interest in viruses and mechanisms of viral pathogenesis has not waned and the recent covid-19 outbreak prompted me to do a little investigation on my own.

My studies of blood microRNA changes after TBI and AD suggest that principal component analysis of distinct changes in circulating miRNAs can identify the patient population. MicroRNA alterations can be measured by real-time PCR which Ipresume is the basis of the test that is developed for this disease but Iam analyzing blood miRNA-seq expression profiles and now it is possible to quickly sequence blood samples in a few hours and get accurate results. Blood gene expression in my studies was more variable (lots of RNases in blood) so I found that microRNAs are much more stable in blood and serum samples.

Iattach an example of a PCA/hierarchical clustering heatmap analysis of a GEO dataset for MERs-coV from 2016  https://www .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/guery/ acc.cgi?acc=GSE81852
I performed the PCA and heatmap analyses at two different stringencies and you can see that the
patients can be unequivocably distinguished from the controls at very significant p and FDR values.


Just a thought but many clinical centers, hospitals, academic institutions can quickly perform transcriptome-wide sequencing. Blood RNA can be isolated in 1-2 hrs, sequencing libraries made in a few hres and one miRNA sequencing run can handle up to 48 samples and the data can be quickly analyzed.

Just my two cents on how NIH could accelerate the analysis of new blood samples for this new strain of coronanvirus. You could mobilize hundreds of sequencing centers to help in the analysis.

Subject:California DMV Coronavirus exposure danger




Dear Dr. Fauci,

Iam writing to alert you to what I believe is a serious coronavirus health threat in California that is being posed by the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

It has long been the policy of the California OMV that all drivers  OVER 70 YEARS OLD must
renew their drivers licenses IN PERSON at DMV offices.

DMV offices are notorious for being extremely crowded and requiring long wait times where people are breathing on each other touching each other and undisinfected surfaces and touch screens for hours.

As far as I am aware OMV offices are never sanitized so germs from thousands of people can remain there
for weeks on end.

This  is obviously a dangerous environment for anyone in the current worldwide coronavirus emergancy
yet nobody in the news media is reporting on it or even seems aware of the danger.
In light of your recent statement warning people over to 60 to avoid crowds this California OMV policy
seems to be incredibly irresponsible and even life threatening but nobody is doing anything about it.

Ifind this situation  to be utterly absurd since  Newsom is allowing California citizens to be exposed to exactly the kind of coronavirus danger he claims to be preventing and apparently does not even know that the DMV is totally contradicting his emergency declaration,the CDC recommendations, the California State  Health Department, the Los Angeles County Health Department, and the Pasadena City Health Department.

(b)(6)
                                                      I am concerned that nobody seems to see the obvious public health threat  None of the relevant public health agencies have any information about this

on their websites and the California OMV website makes NO MENTION WHATSOEVER of Coronavirus
as a health threat in there overcrowded offices.

Iwould sincerely like to know what you make of this dangerous  DMV policy.  Ialso want to tell you that the Californai DMV is currently advertising on the radio asking even more people to crowd DMV offices in order to
get the REAL ID license.

REAL ID further exacerbates the danger by drawing in more than  NINE MILLION Californians  to leave their germs in OMV offices over the next few months at the exact time we are in the midst of the greatest health emergency of this century and the most important recommendation is to AVOID
CROWDS and stay at least six feet away from other people.	Try staying six feet away from anyone in a crowded OMV office where hundreds of people are stuffed in like sardines.

Obviously a rational policy would be to suspend the requirement for drivers over 70 to renew in person and simply
let them renew by mail until the coronavirus emergency is over.
The same should be done for REAL ID. A total suspension to protect public health in a crisis is the only sane thing to do.

If Iwere the  Director of the California  OMV Iwould close all offices immediately and disinfect every inch
of them, and not reopen until the coronavirus emergency is over.
Iwould require that all OMV business should be done by mail or internet until the coronavirus threat is over.

Please tell me what you think about all this and Iwill forward your response to local Pasadena officials since state level officials are almost impossible to contact even in an emergency when they most need to get this  kind of information from the public but apparently do not want to know about  bad news.

Igreatly appreciate your  voice of reason in these  scary times.  Iwish the officials of the State of California
were  as reasonable but they are apparently  oblivious to a serious and unnecessary danger being created by
one of their own state agencies.


Sincerely

Cocktail of flu, HIV drugs appears to help fight coronavirus: Thai doctOfSReuiersFebruary 2, 2020

By Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai doctors have seen success in treating
severe cases of the new coronavirus with combination of medications for
flu and HIV, with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours after applying the treatment, they said on Sunday.

The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days.

The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltamivir in large doses.



"This is not the cure, but the patient's condition has vastly improved . From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours," Dr. Kriangska Atipornwanich , a lung specialist at Rajavithi, told reporters.
"The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine
that this can be a standard treatment."

Chinese health officials have already been administering the HIV and flu drugs to fight the coronavirus. The use of the three together in a cocktail seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said.

Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed improvement.

"We have been following international practices, but the doctor increased the dosage of one of the drugs," said Somsak Akkslim, director-general of the Medical Services Department , referring to the flu
medicine Oseltamivir.

Thailand has recorded  19 cases of coronavirus. Of the Thai patients,
eight have recovered and gone home while 11 are still under treatment in hospitals.

Somsak said the health ministry will meet on Monday to discuss the successful treatment in the case of the 70-year-old but said it is still too soon to say that this approach can be applied to all cases.


Initially we will apply this approach only to severe cases," he said. (Reporting by Panu Wongcha-um; Editing by Peter Graff)

The cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been continuously increasing ever since its outbreak in China last December. Currently,there are no approved drugs to treat the infection. In this scenario, there is a need to utilize the existing repertoire of FDA approved drugs to treat the disease. The rational selection of these drugs could be made by testing their ability to inhibit any SARS-CoV-2 proteins essential for viral life-cycle.

We chose one such crucialviral protein, the papain-like protease (Plpro), to screen the FDA approved drugs in silico. The homology model of the protease was built based on the SARS-coronavirus Plpro structure, and the drugs were docked in S3/S4 pockets of the active site of the enzyme . In our docking studies, sixteen FDA approved drugs, including chloroquine and formoterol, was found to bind the target enzyme with significant affinity and good geometry , suggesting their potential to be utilized against the virus.

Tony,that part of the message was not directed at you . Peter Staley and I have seen you in action on TV and I've forced	(b) C   to watch you talking about social distancing, since she says the President says she has nothing to worry about. Bob Redfield and Secretary Azar haven't been as forthright as you have.
The main thing that concerns many people I know: the roll-out of testing, surveillance has been botched and we're likely to have cases of COVID in our communities already without knowing it. Meanwhile some corporations, some universities, some other institutions have started to put social distancing into place, with a few municipalities doing the same, but there is no real guidance from CDC on when to act for most of us. There are plenty of instructions about getting prepared, but all seem to point towards waiting until there is an outbreak in one's community to do anything substantial, which seems if you'll excuse my language, ass-backwards, as one you see multiple cases, you're likely to already have widespread community transmission.
Ithink this piece by Bill Hanage at Harvard explains whe re a lot of us are right now:

Stay well, we need you more than ever (and Imean that from the bottom of my heart). Most of the career civil servants on the email were copied not to chastise, it's the political appointees that most think got us into this mess.

Dear Tony, Bob and Deb et al,
The AIDS experts among you know me well. We've been first adversaries then colleagues for over 30 years.
They also know Ican't keep my mouth shut, which is a virtue and a failing, depending on the context. Now:
There are thousands of people waiting for advice from our federal government on broader social
distancing measures in light of the fact that our failure in early testing and surveillance means the
coronavirus is likely already spreading in our communities .
If you thought the ire of AIDS activists 30 years ago was tough, the anger now spreading among researchers, scientists, clinicians and activists is going to be a conflagration.
All we see is genuflection in word and deed from most of you to a White House that wants this all to magically go away.
Yes, I know you're all doing your best and behind the scenes our federal government is hard at work. For
those I know, Idon't doubt your commitment to public service. But time is running out.
We need vocally, unequivoca l leadership now, that offers real guidance to communities about what to
do, what might happen next.
Your own legacies will be defined by this moment, what you do and what you don't, what you shy away from saying because you fear for your jobs or your short-term fortunes in the eyes of the President.
The status quo is untenable.
It's going to get people killed by this virus .

Sean :
  As per our recent conversation, here is a paper that is under review at the NEJM .   It is from Dr. Vincent  Munster who works in my institute.   It confirms what we surmised that after almost two weeks, the chances of viable virus being present in the facility is extremely low based on his studies reported in this paper. Figure lB in the paper is of particular relevance regarding our discussion of surfaces.

How the experiments were done:
Aerosol -A solution of live virus was made and aerosolized in a rotating drum (keeping it in aerosol form);at various time points, air was removed and amount of v irus measured (using end-point titration on Vero cells).

Surface - A base solutions of live virus was made and placed on specific surfaces (plastic, etc) and at various time points, coating was taken away and virus contained was titrated.

Note that surface experiments with proteinaceous material (e.g., respiratory secretions) are underway, as are variations in relative humidity and temperature.

How do you interpret aerosol data?
Decay in aerosols occurs over three hours,so if the virus is aerosolized (via aerosol-generat ing procedures or cough), the moment it drops below a certain threshold, it would be hard to get an infectious dose/infection . Of course we do not actually know the infectious dose, which limits our ability to give firm guidance based on this data.

How do you interpret the surface stability data?
Copper seems to have some virucidal effect, as is seen with other viruses. Plastic and stainless steel don't have much of an effect on the virus itself, and the virus persists for some time. As for cardboard, difficult to interpret because the surface absorbs a good deal, but there is some immediate decay.

Should we be concerned about packages based on your data?
This is of far lower concern than droplet and other fomite transmission. Typical shipping will allow ample time for viral decay, and the cardboard itself seems to have some direct effect on the virus (either through absorption or other effect) . For example, in the experiment, Vincent applied
lOeS viral particles/ml and it drops 2 logs to 10e3 immediately, indicating that either due to absorption or direct effect on the virus.

Of course, if a mail carrier coughs on a package and then someone touches it directly after, there may be a risk. The typical shipping situation is likely not a concern.

Why are SARS-CoV-2 vs. SARS-CoV-1 different?
For the cardboard data in particular, there is a difference seen between SARS-CoV-2 and 1, which is likely due to error/variation in surface.

Subject: Hazardous use of Remdesivir in CoV-19

Dear Dr Fauci,


Iam copying below a letter I just sent to the editors of Lancet and NEJM that Ithink you should also read. It's informal as it is not meant for publication but just as a concern. Since I no longer work as a virologist, I am formally out of the field. Iam however active as chief psychiatrist in Stockholm, Sweden. If you have doubts as to my expertise as a virologist or a physician, Dr Bernard Roizman at U of C knows me very well, as Markus Heilig does here in Sweden.




"I have noticed a striking difference in mortality by CoV-19 in different countries. China and Italy have a mortality that's at least 6-fold higher than that in South Korea. So far Germany and Scandinavia, totalling over 1300 cases, have not reported a single death. That's over a 35-40 fold difference.




Looking at the data more closely, I have found that China and Italy have been u sing the antiviral Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences) extensively on many patients in intensive care, ju stified as "compassionate use". In the epidemic areas of Italy this drug is now part of treatment guidelines for hospitalised patients , used on every single patient in "critical condition" . (see attachment). The "rationale" is simply that the first two cases treated at the SpaHa.nzani Hospital in Rome received this drug, and...well, achially survived.

Remdesivir has never passed a Phase 3 trial, but has already made big headlines in major international newspapers. Neither South Korea nor Germany or Scandinavian countries have yet used this drug.




Iunderstand that this is a (relatively) long shot, but given the number of lives at stake, I would recommend that a carefully scrutiny by the scientific community on the use of this drug is warranted.




I have no conflict of interest. Thank you for your attention".

Subject: BIO Coronavirus Collaboration Initiative March 12th Summit - POSTPONED




Dear Colleagues,

BIO is heartened that so many of you have expressed interest in joining  us for the BIO Coronavirus Collaboration Initiative Summit planned for March 12, 2020. Given the evolving circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, and after discussions with our Board leadership, we have decided to postpone the BIO Summit so that we can make adequate arrangements to hold the meeting virtually. We made this decision out of an abundance of caution, so as to avoid placing anyone at unnecessary risk of
exposure while we work together to improve our nation's ability to respond to this outbreak. We will re-schedule this virtual meeting within the next two weeks using a digital technology that can allow
for robust discussion among the participants.

In the interim, we plan to send out a short questionnaire on Monday to all company participants requesting information on your product, technology or service, which we plan to compile in a digital "book" and share with all participants in advance of the meeting . We believe this approach will help to make the meeting more efficient, allowing us to quickly shift to discussions of the

most important shared challenges and potential opportunities that exist between industry members, government leaders and non­ government partners.

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. We will move quickly to establish a new date for this meeting and appreciate your flexibility in this regard. We look forward to talk ing with many of you then.

Thanks again for your commitment to enhancing the health and safety of people facing this outbreak around the globe.

Sincerely,

Tony--
It has been awhile since we have worked together since my time as the senior SES standing up DTRA (with the help of Josh Lederberg M.D. &Dave Franz DVM who you know), at Argonne/UofChicago  establishing your NIAID RBL with Olaf Schneewind M.D., and as the OHS Director of Research reporting to SEC Michael Chertoff &UIS Jay Cohen (RADM-
ret). Michael &Jay brought me aboard when Jay was our Chief of
Naval Research at ONR and I was ONR's Executive Director
&Chief Scientist. I know you have your hands very full with the

COVID-19 threat, so I wanted to give you a heads up that a game changer for enhanced detection of COVID-19 has emerged. Thanks to DARPA &OHS S&T sponsorship in years past of ANOE developing a real time Rapid DNA microfluidics system for human identification, the ANOE group has a breakthrough for detection of COVID-19 and to the future, other emerging threat viruses.

As you may know the ANOE system for human identification (e.g. CT &OHS missions) is mature and now deployed operationally/tactically  by CENTCOM, DIA, the IC and used most recently by OHS in their recent test bed in El Paso to
demonstrate its effective capabilities to determine family relationship in undocumented minors. Additionally ANOE is in use by law enforcement and by officials responding to mass casualty events (CA 2018 Camp Fire disaster, 2019 Conception dive boat fire, and the very recent 2020 tragic helicopter crash) to ID the victims.

The ANOE system now provides 2 hour turnaround with no special training requirements as a stand-alone system for all the above users. Our warfighters and special operators are using the ANOE system now in field forward operations and it meets
MIL specs &is the only system certified for data submission to the

Dear Dr. Fauci:



Im a first responder, andIbelieve an oral vaccine platform is the best delivery method for situations of national emergency like the coronavirus.

If the vacci ne is a tablet, we would be able to keep them on our ambulances and get medical authorization whenever the situation arises. First responders can then treat patients before doctors and nurses and also instead of having the patient make an appointment Or having them wait in line for a shot, which can ultimately cause more spread.

This method that will enable the EMS teams of the nation to combat outbreaks because you would allow EMT (Emergency Medical Technicians) and Paramedics to diffuse situation s through our Ambulances. This will lead to more control and get a hold of the situations as fast as possible and lower the spread of the virus on our people.

Thank you.

Dear Sir,

I am sending this message to assist in an idea to help minimize the impact of Coronavirus. Instead of people going to the hospital or urgent care. Each county health department needs to have a direct number of a national number that distributes information to local county governmen t health department. If you are sick and show or exhibit signs of the coronavirus you should call the appropriate number , a technician will come to your home, draw lab specimen needed. Of course if someone is extremely ill they should call 911 and advise 911 they are exhibiting
signs of the virus. There shou ld be special protocols in place for how to transport the patient into the hospital as well (to limit exposure to everyone involved. This means finding alternative entrance at hospitals for a suspected coronavirus patient. These patients should be brought in by a least used location of the hospital into a special unit that has a batTier from the rest of the emergency department.
Home lab work will keep someone from sitting in a waiting room for 3_ 5 hours.
The county un it to conduct lab work will act in response much like calling 911 or the police. Each hospital need.;; to set up an emergency entrance for Coronavirus patients only, and the unit must be sealed from the remainder of the unit. We begin having a coronavirns team that does not cross contaminate to any other unit on the emergency room floor. I am thinking of the best plausible way to minimize outbreak . This helps.

Dear Tony
A note to let you know how much over the years I have appreciated your active  support of biologic research, public health and your directorship of NIAID. Impressive, intelligent, high integrity and management skills has placed you at the head of the curve. I reached this conclusion from
personal observat ions of your work and style as well as having served as a
consultant for NIAID and several other NIH Institutions, WHO, Pasteur and Karolinska .


After nearly 50 years of continuous research from my original AI09484
grant studying viral pathogenesis[ acute and persistent infections] using the LCMV model, I decided to close my laboratory. I have had other generous NIH support as well especially for investigations of other negative strand viruses[ primarily measles and influenza, Lassa ,arenavirus receptor], Ebola, cytokine storm and autoimmun ity. The AI09484 grant was credited by 300 peer reviewed papers, training of 61 postdoctoral fellows[ including Rafi Ahmed, Christine Biron, Persephone Borrow, Ray Welsh, Ian Lipkin, Dorian McGavern and other successes including the late Patrick Sissons who was the Reagent Professor of Medicine at Cambridge . Over 85°/o of these folk are in academic medicine/biology at research institutes or universities.


Good luck and smooth sailing with the current coronavirus pandemic. With your involvement this work is in good hands.


Best wishes Michael

Dear Dr. Fauci;

Iam a toxicologist and have spent time, years ago , working in the arena of oncogenic virology as part of NCI programs. I am very concerned about what I see in the news media about the NIH approach to the COVID-19 pandemic (yes, pandemic) that has arrived in our country .There is much talk about development of a vaccine, however , I believe that this is a long-term strategy. You and Iboth know, from working as scientists, that the development and trial of an antiviral vaccine is a months-long program,at best. I am surprised, even disappointed , that there seems to be no visible
focus on the part of the NIH on the development of anti-viral treatments (drugs etc) . It is my professional opinion that anti-virals would take a shorter time to develop than vaccines , yet it appears that this may be a back burner focus of NIH.

I realize that there are many political pressures on your office and Isupport your strong efforts to apply science to the resolution of this growing problem . Please do not give short shrift to the potential of antiviral treatments in favor of the longer-term promise of a vaccine .

Respectfully yours,

Dear Mr. Vice President & Task Force Members -

My name is Jeffrey "Scott"  Smith.   I live in	CbH   KS.  For the past 35 years I have been a  Purchasing Agent in the  private sector.   Much of my career  has dealt with China sourcing  and supplier  development.     I have established  a wide  network  of  suppliers  and contacts  throughout  China.   You can see from  my  US Passport  number		CbH6J that I have traveled  to China  for the  past 20 years ... including spending  nearly	CbH6> my time  in 2018  & 2019  visiting  China  suppliers.  (Thankfully  Ireturned  on  15-Nov-2019 , prior to the outbreak...	CbH6l.)

I was invited by one of my trusted suppliers to offer One Step COVID-19 test kits to the United States.  The Guangzhou based su  e,!!er has	CbH4> test kits available now for immediate shipment.  They can produce	(b)(4 ' kits per week at their factory.  Please see the information below and the materials attached for more information.  This is a very cost effective test - and provides results in 15 minutes.  I will trust you to determine the efficacy of the diagnostics.

To be clear - this is not my business. I will profit in no way from providing these kits to the American healthcare public -- except for the satisfaction of doing my patriotic duty to assist my fellow Americans.  I fully understand the gravity and seriousness of this disease. All of my factories in China have, and are, suffering from the effect and fall
out.  My business in	CbH	is dealing with the effects of the supply chain disruptions .

I hope that this offer , and availability of a additional test kit pipeline, will help ease the
test kit shortage that we are experiencing in the USA. If you and your Procurement

Offices would like more information or would like to secure these test kits, please
contact me. I can assist in arranging supplier contacts and immediate air shipments .

I certainly  thank you and the many dedicated leaders in the USA for your great work to combat COVID-19  - and for the care that you are showing the American public.

Best regards,

Scott Smith

It seems COVJ D-19 causes greater problems for the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, as you have said.




Why not try giving those with active disease, or those at risk, gamma-globu lin, to ameliorate the effects of the illness?




It would be especially interesting to prepare batches of gamma globulin using the blood (2,000- 3,000 donors) of people who have, or who have recovered from, COVID-19 infection.




There is ample precedent for using Gamma-globulin to prevent or treat viral illnesses (Hepatit is A, B) or
diseases of unknown etiology (ie Kawasaki's).




This could be useful especially while we wait for the development of a vaccine .




What do you think?

Subject: From ER Provider, Some Common sense COVID-19 addJ. suggestions




Dr. Fauci:
I have been following you and others on CS PAN with appreciation.
1) Please ensure you are all getting adequate sleep.
 (There is too much yahoo-machismo in our field) Please put forth recommendations for providers and their employers.
2) Isee the CDC warning about herbals, which Iagree with except for one:
echinacea, just about the only herbal with proven medical usefulness, not as it is
  recommended on the bottles or websites, but as only a single 2 capsules, on day one of viral illness. Echinacea demarginates the matured bone marrow leukocytes. Used as a "one shot deal"
may decrease COVID-19 duration/severity as eg.: "take right away on day one,
drink plenty of water and sleep as long as necessary".
  Please at least study the use of Echinacea in this manner for COVID-19. {Google is suddenly missing Echinacea's mechanism/use info, so please have this corrected, if for nothing else to prevent hoarding. One bottle can be for a whole neighborhood and please ask the drug stores to offer "two packs" with proper instructions.
eg.: "take only two as soon as ill with cold or flu and not take more, but to
replenish the immune system follow up with fresh fruits and vegetables, etc.
3) Make sure we have enough Ventolin, Proventil available so those with new asthmatic component due to COVI0-19 can call their Dr. for RX if they cannot blow out a match, for
instance, and use the drive through instead of goin into the pharmacy. Consider
hazmat for drive through testing and Rx pharmacy staff (as in S. Korea). Iwould be interested in knowing the percent of COVID-19 respiratory sufferers who can stay home but will need Ventolin. 10%? (just a guess from seeing bronchitis in the ER).

4) Ensure all the medical providers with offices, give out their office telephone numbers and have staff trained to triage calls so people can stay home until they are well.
5) Ensure levothyroxine (the US most common Rx) is made in the USA from
ingredients made in the USA. Ditto for down the line of the most necessary and common RX, including Ventolin, and the antibiotics that would treat bacterial superinfection of COVID-19 (particularly the ones that can be used at home: macrolides, etc.)
6) Encourage prevention of superinfection with clean respiratory toilet, hydration, chest PT preferred over suctioning, clean environment, including cleaning floors daily . One of the most successful methods of chest PT involves the patient lying on the bed with their face near the floor. Decreasing the load of pulmonary sputum is critical.
7) There is very large number of semi-retired physicians, such as myself who would
probably like to be utilized (an paid a little) for telemedicine to assist with triage.
  We can do telemed icine at home. Iam not set up to do this but will soon be set up and able. We need to know which companies we can trust to hire us.
  There should be telemedicine training and tracking coming from the CDC or other state and national governments .
8) Is the 3/3/20 John Kehoe Financial Times article correct? Is it not best to predict mortality so as to more realistically prepare for post-COV ID-19 recovery economically and socially and give confidence by being transparent?
I see recovery jo bs being the young taking care of the old after most have had it
and been cured or succumbed. Then the other half of the people will get it, too...
  Is there some stigma attached to the word "infrastructure" that would prevent recovery of our economy?
9) I do not wee the recommendations for Flu and both pneumovax vaccines, but
the recommendation needs to get out broadly right away.
10) Wuhan had to truck in food ...how are we planning? Canned food decreases one's immune system. Fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen or dried are needed.
11) China closed all the theaters ...and we should also start closing the use of public places, particularly asking folks in their 60's and older to stay home now.
12) Recommend providers write three month supply of Rx for all patients, to decrease visits out and ensure availability.
13) The closure of schools might spread COVID-19 unless children have food to eat at home and the parents comply.
14) Will census takers spread it? Should the census be postponed or performed via hazmat suit or in another fashion?
This is a long list. Please look into 2-pac ks of Echinacea with instructions.
Get enough sleep/stay well. Thank you.

Gretchen Boise, MD

Dear Tony:


As I continue to follow the evolution of this disastrous calamity, I continue to think of possible approaches to dealing with therapeutic options that might be "off the beaten trail" but nonetheless worth considering - especially for those patients who are at high risk for debilitation and, possibly, death. Ishare one such thought with you here.


Several years ago, recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rHGH) was reported to be significantly effective  in restoring/ enhancing T cell anti-viral activity in patients infected with HIV (citation below) :


Growth hormone resurrects adult human thymus during HIV-1 infection

Kiki Tesselaar, Frank Miedema
J   Clinlnvest.  2008; 1L 8(3):844-847. https://doi.org/10.1l72/JC135112.



My thought is that since, in many ways, elderly patients afflicted with COVID -19 fall into a similar category, that treatment with

rHGH might be an effective treatment alternative to employ during this immediate time frame while you are exploring more specific alternatives.

I look forward to your thoughts on this, and best wishes,

David

Hello and thank you for all of your tireless efforts in dealing with the coronavirus.


I have a concern about the universities and the spread of this virus . Many schools brought back students from study abroad before the 14 day quarantine was put into place, and even after the quarantine was put in place, many students did not follow the quarantine rules. Also, with shared dorms and apartments it was not possible for student's who returned to campuses and not their homes. By the times schools came up with a plan for quarantining the student's it was well over a week after some were back. Therefore, there is potential for widespread infection.

The vice president said the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions are at risk and should take caution in where they go, avoid crowded places
etc..Millions of students have asthma, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, and they do not have a choice other than to go to class. The government does not seemed concerned about the potential spread among campuses and what a disaster this could be. They have voiced why grade schools are not closed (since younger are not at risks better for them to be at school) but they are ignoring college kids are at risk and the impact of widespread infection on a campus could be huge. Students i H6 colleges travel back and forth to the city all the time, and I am concerned schools are not temporarily closing until more testing is available and we see where this goes. At minimum, giving student's with underlying medical conditions the option to go home and work remotely. Right now they do not have

any option other than to go to class. When questioned they say they are listening
to the CDC and state government.	(b)(6)
and students are not following the advice to stay home sick and nobody seems
concerned about trying to prevent infection.


Can the government please look at a temporary ban on classes at Universities in states where infection is rapidly spreading, especially knowing there are not enough test available yet. The schools are not taking action on their own and this is a frustrating situation seeing delays in decisions making.

Thank you for your time in consideration in addr

Dr. Fauci,
I appreciate the efforts of the WHO taking a look into the temperature question. It is helpful to understand the virus and know what to expect.	Cb) (6) is a professional data analyst of large datasets like census

data, for example. I was wondering if it would be possible to obtain the WHO dataset to see if there were any angles not considered. I am certain that the WHO's biostatisticians know what they are doing, but data is a funny thing. You get the answers to the questions you ask. If the right questions were not asked, you may miss useful information.
Regarding the subject line, if the theory is true that children have some cross-reactive protection due to antibody production to the harmless coronavirus population, that would mean that pediatricians would also carry very high levels of protective antibody. If this is true, then plasmapheresis might provide anti­ coronavirus antibody as potential treatment. I do not know enough about plasmapheresis to know if this could be applied to scale but I wanted to pass along the thought	Cb) <6l

Subject: Pis advise to allow return air travel only ,stop all other air travel



Dear Dr. Fauci,



Thank you for your leadership and guidance in this difficult time. I am a pediatrician in Massachusetts, and as you  know,direct-linkage  from  travel  cases  are popping up on the East Coast. In order to keep the community viral load down, keeping new cases from moving around the country and the world will delay the spread and amplification of the viral
load. According to my observations, hot climates seem to be having a favorable new case rate. Based on the city of Qom versus the experience in Singapore and Australia, it appears that the transition temperature for efficient spread is somewhere above when there are highs around 50 degrees F,similar to H1N1. According to my observations , prior to seasonal flu, the transition temperature was closer to highs of 40 degrees F. This theory should be
testable . For example ,there are new cases in Kuwait
and Bahrain. If I am right, if you tested a subset of these populations , you would find a very high rate of asymptomatic infection , probably 80-90%, because that's how many people it would take to shed small amounts of virus to create a community viral load to make someone sick enough to get tested. If this is true , this bodes well for the virus burning itself out to endemic status relatively quickly. This would be very reassuring data you could provide to reduce panic - if you can tell people you know how long this pandemic is going to last rather than saying that we don't know.



Although some experts may say that restricting travel will only delay the inevitable, this is not a valid statement if the transition temperature for effect spread really is 50 degrees. A delay of significant community spread in the US until highs reach the 50s for the Northeast where the population is the most

dense would have a massive life-saving effect, but if this is to occur, the flight restriction needs to happen now.



Stopping all flights would be impractical and inhumane, but allowing return flights only and stopping all other air travel would be effective . It would have a massive effect on the economy, but so will overwhelming corona virus infection. No one will die because they can't take a vacation or business trip. Financial losses would need to be settled later, so this would require emergency declarations , etc. If you wanted to take it in a step-wise manner , you could start with international flights and then move on to domestic flights if necessary - this would probably be wise and would have a less severe impact on the economy.



Thank you again, and Iam sure this is one of thousands of unsolicited emails . I wish you the very best and God grant you wisdom.



Best,

David Chung

Dear Bob,

Long time, no see. Our SARS study (JID 2006, 193:1244-1249; see the attachment) showed selective expansions of Vy9Vo2 T cells in survivors of SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, stimulated Vy9Vo2 T cells also display
an interferon-y-dependent anti-SARS-CoV activity and are able to directly kill
SARS-CoV-infected cells. Since it is very easy to activate human Vy9Vo2 T cells in vivo (e.g., using FDA-approved and relatively non-toxic drugs for treating bone-demineralization) and given the similarities between SARS­ CoV and SARS-CoV-2, I thought that it could be potentially useful to bring these facts to your and Tony's attention, in spite of knowing that both of you are probably slightly busier these days than you would like to be.

All the best and good luck with everything, Yours as ever,
Mirek

Dear Anthony Fauci,
As [understand tbe fatal cases of covid-19 develop pneumonia after several days of
symptoms of the acute viral infection.
In this way the present conoravirus infection is very like our present and previous fatal influenza virus infections. In the 1918 pandemic many if not most of the fatal cases were caused by bacterial superinfection with hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci. The former is rather seldom now, but the pneumococcal  infections are
common.
Should we advice persons over >65 y as well as people with chronic diseases with increased risk of fatal corona\'irus diseases to be vacc inated against pneumococci now?
My best regards and thank you for your significant contribution to inflammatory
medicine and infections.

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Iam so happy to continue seeing you in press conferences and on news broadcasts.


Please keep making those public appearances. Amer icans need to hear the facts from someone who is trustworthy .

Iam sure that tiptoeing around Donald Trump has dramatically complicated your life. I hope that you will find ways to "correct" or "clarify" the constant stream of misstatements that he makes- our lives depend upon it.(Maybe Trump could wear a hazmat suit - to protect his fragile ego from any possible bruising caused by a collision with the truth. Just kidding.)

Seriously, Doctor, it is a huge relief to see and hear you and your expert colleagues . It is to the point that we cannot believe a single word that comes out of Trump's mouth.

Very sincerely,
Elizabeth Stevens

Hi Dr Fauci,
Has anyone considered the possibility that previous coronavims infection(s) associated with common colds may result in at least partial inummity to the COVID-19 virus? This may explain why the disease is generally mild in 80% of adults and apparently rare in cl1ildren (most of whom get more frequent colds than adults). I would be pleased to hear your thoughts.

Subject: A vaccine with anti immunosuppressive properties
Importance:Low




Dear Dr Fauci,

Common wisdom tells us that the inability to immunize against HIV, malaria etc. as well as the need to
repeat evry year anti flu vaccination  result from the excessive, or limitless, genetic

variability of the underlying pathogens. While not doubting the reality of this genetic variability, best observed in an orderly manner in the case of HIV, I considered the possibility that these pathogens are endowed wiith an immunosuppressive capacity that is not inactivated during vaccine production, and that current vaccines do not induce immunity against such
immunosuppression. Iapplied this reasonning when I worked on an AIDS vaccine in

1991 in Zagury's lab

(Halbreich A et al. (1992) Vaccine  Research,4 :397-412). Indeed, we tested then , in suitably immunized animals, the effect of the various preparations on the cellular response to tuberculin and the capacity of animals to be
Immunized against tuberculin and tetanus as a function of the exrent of treatment. The immune response to these agents was indeed higher in the presence of hivions compared to heat inactivated preparations. This HIVION preparation was used on 6 patients in Zaire (Zagury et al. (1992) J Acquired  Immune Deficiency Syndromes,
5 :676-681).

Unfortunately, when Itried to make a greater prep for a phase I trial, the viral preparation turned out (too late),
by SOS gel elecrophoresis , not to contain any viral protein, due either to degradation or another mishap. I left Zagury 's lab soon after and it was impossible for me later to obtain material (either viral or from recombinant protein) to further advance the matter. I do believe that tuning vaccine preparation to counter immunosuppressive effect of the virus (parasite) while preserving its capacity to induce anti viral immunity should resolve the need to revaccinate every year against the same virus. In fact, identifying the epitopes, acting for immunity and those
acting against immunosuppression, at a later stage should allow a better result than we obtained. (It is not yet known whether corona virus also mutates rapidly, but I heard that a woman was reinfected after having recovered from covid-19 infection and this might indicate a capacity of the virus to counteract the host's immune response.
In	(bH6» I have been itching ever since to go back to

unfinished projects, but did not

find an avenue. Now, with the outburst of the corona virus r:>andemic this surfaces again.

Outside the American Israel Public Affairs Co1nmittee (AIPAC) annual conference in Washington , DC on March, 01, 2020. (J\.1arvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

WASHINGTON (JTA) -The American Israel Public Affairs Committee said that at least two people who attended the lobby's policy conference have tested positive for the coronaVIrus.

The conference, which ran from Feb. 28-March 2, drew
18,000 activists to Washington.

The AIPAC statement posted late Friday on Twitter said the two people who tested positive are from New York. The outbreak has been especially hard on the Orthodox Jewish community in Westchester County, and AIPAC listed the county's health department as among the authorities with which it is in communication.

The others are the New York Health Department, national health authorities and the District of Columbia Health Department. The statement also said the lobby was consulting with Edward Septimus, a professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M University.

The statement posted on Twitter said an email was going out to all attendees as well as to congressional offices. The conference routinely attracts a majority of Congress members and their staffers.

Dear Dr. Fauci,
I saw that you are discussing the steps we need to take to make the impact of COVID-19 a minimum in CNN and decided to write to you what we did as faculty in this aspect.
I believe that prevention is much more important than treatment later. As a
preparation for the COVID-19 outbreak, two days ago, I made a personal decision to make all my homework online submission so that we may avoid the spread of the virus anymore.
Students work on homework for hours and can easily spread the virus w ithout knowing it. Once it goes to graders (my TAs), they then spread it to the rest of the class, again without knowing it. Thus, an innocent act can be devastating. So, in simply two-three days it may spread to another 100 new individuals easily . Graders may act as hubs in this case. The danger is, it may have spread to another hundred or more new individuals even before it comes to a detectable level from any test.
I also want to emphasis the following points:

1. We hear in all news that elderly people are the most vulnerable. But Ithink it should be corrected as people with immunodeficiency are the most vulnerable and elderly are in that category. Some one who is 10 years old and have diabetic or HIV has the same danger as an elderly person.
2. We should come up with a test such as a pregnancy test, which can be done at home without leaving their homes. This stops further spreading.
3. We should discuss foods that help cure it fast and things that we should not
do.

Ihave shared my thoughts with CNN (Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Anderson Cooper as well). Thank you for your time and everything you do to our community at this critical moment.
Best, Udita

Good Evening Dr Fauci ,
I have an idea for your consideration for the Coronavirus vaccine/treatment.
Noting that the virus is attacking our elderly more and knowing their lungs are older and not as functional to fight this infection. Have you considered artificial surfactant to boost lung function .	(b) (6)

Perhaps if their lungs are stronger to expand they could fight the virus better. Thank you for listening, My prayers are with our Healthcare Professional s to achieve a treatment/vaccine.

Dear Dr. Fauci,


I live in the United Kingdom and listen to your recent press briefings from White House. First of all, Iwant to convey my sincerest thanks to you for providing valuable information to the general public.

Iwould greatly appreciate it if you can advise on what precautions Ishould take




                                                     . Shou ld he try to avoid all social contact, and of course avoid any cruise. air or public transport to prevent him from getting the infection?
I would greatly appreciate your advice on this. Regards
Raja

Subject; Developing Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and lvlg


Dear Dr. Fauci and Dr. Lane:


Ihave been following the growing international outbreak of COVID-19 and wanted to share a thought with you, understanding that this may have already been thought of.  My early academic research (reference provided, PNAS) involved cancer immunology where it contributed to a growing body of information that certain tumor cells could possess unique surface antigens that could be used for immunologic therapy
( https://www . pnas.org/content/pnas/75/12/5912.fu ll.pdf). My career then took me to executive and senior executive/corporate officer positions in publicly-held pharmaceutical corporations (Glaxo and Sa lix, respectively) overseeing R&D of therapeutic agents. My experience has included both pharmaceuticals and biologics.

(b)(6






Our current understanding of COVID-19 mortality is that it appears to be concentrated in the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. In healthy individuals (although still early) it appears that many of

those infected with SARS-CoV-2 may remain symptom free or develop mild disease, or recover from more severe illness. Currently there are tens of thousands of individuals who have been identified as having been infected but are considered 'recovered'. That being case it would seem plausible that they have mounted an antibody response to the virus.

The question is whether these individuals are being tested for antibody titre to the virus, and if that is occurring whether they are being approached to donate plasma to move into lglv production. With this illness still in its early stages and being international, Iwould imagine that such an effort would involve a public/private sector endeavor. Understanding the difficulty in developing a vaccine for 'cold viruses', lvlG may be a way to at least reduce the mortality in our most vulnerable patients. So, the slow start we have had in testing the US population for this virus goes beyond disease prevention - it would certainly be affecting our ability, to some degree,of rapidly developing a more targeted intervention for high risk patients.

dy thought of t his, but as a concerned citizen having some background and an
                        ,I wanted to share these thoughts.  Understanding your busy schedules,I have copied both the Director and Deputy Director for Clinica l Research and Special Projects.

Respectfully submitted,


Arthur R.Kamm, PhD

Q&A
Inside China's All-Out War on the Coronavirus Dr. Bruce Aylwa rd, of the W.H.O., got a rare glimpse into Beijing's campaign to stop the epidemic. Here's what he saw.



Dr. Bruce Aylwa rd, leader of the W.H.O. team that visited China to assess the country's response to the coronavirus outbreak.Cred it...Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone, via Associated Press


By Donal d G. McNeil Jr.

 March 4, 2020
As the leader of the World Health Organization team that visited China, Dr. Bruce Aylward feels he has been to the mountaintop - and has seen what's possible.
During a two-week visit in early February, Dr.Aylward saw how China rapidly suppressed the coronavirus outbreak that had engulfed Wuhan, and was threatening the rest of the country .
New cases in China have dropped to about 200 a day,from more than 3,000 in early February. The
numbers may rise again as China's economy begins to revive. But for now, far more new cases are appearing elsewhere in the world.
China's counterattack can be replicated, Dr. Aylward said, but it will require speed, money, imagination and political courage.
For countries that act quickly, containment is still possible "because we don't have a global pandemic -
we have outbreaks occurring globally," he added.

Dr. Aylward, who has 30 years experience in fighting polio, Ebola and other global health emergencies, detailed in an interview with The New York Times how he thinks the campaign against the virus should be run.
This conversation has been edited and condensed.
Do we know what this virus's lethality is? We hear some estimates that it's close to the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed 2.5 percent of its victims, and others that it's a little worse than the seasonal flu, which kills only 0.1 percent. How many cases are missed affects that.
There's this big panic in the West over asymptomatic cases. Many people are asymptomatic when
tested, but develop symptoms within a day or two.
In Guangdong, they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening. Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province. (Covid-19 is the medical name of the illness caused by the coronavirus .)
There is no evidence that we're seeing only the tip of a grand iceberg,with nine-tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus. What we're seeing is a pyramid: most of it is aboveground.
Once we can test antibodies in a bunch of people, maybe I'll be saying, "Guess what? Those data didn't
tell us the story." But the data we have now don't support it.
That's good, if there's little asymptomatic transmission. But it's bad in that it implies that the death rates we've seen - from 0.7 percent in parts of China to 5.8 percent in Wuhan - are correct, right? I've heard it said that "the mortality rate is not so bad because there are actually way more mild cases." Sorry - the same number of people that were dying, still die. The real case fatality rate is probably what it is outside Hubei Province, somewhere between 1and 2 percent.

What about children? We know they are rarely hospitalized. But do they get infected? Do they infect their families?
We don't know. That Guangdong survey also turned up almost no one under 20. Kids got flu, but not
this. We have to do more studies to see if they get it and aren't affected, and if they pass it to family members.But Iasked dozens of doctors: Have you seen a chain of transmission where a child was the index case? The answer was no.

Why? There's a theory that youngsters get the four known mild coronaviruses so often that they're protected.

That's still a theory. Icouldn't get enough people to agree to put it in the W .H.O.report.
Does that imply that closing schools is pointless?
No. That's still a question mark. If a disease is dangerous, and you see clusters, you have to close schools. We know that causes problems, because as soon as you send kids home, half your work force has to stay home to take care of them. But you don't take chances with children.
Are the cases in China really going dow n?
I know there's suspicion, but at every testing clinic we went to, people would say, "It's not like it was three weeks ago." It peaked at 46,000 people asking for tests a day; when we left, it was 13,000. Hospitals had empty beds.
Ididn't see anything that suggested manipulation of numbers.A rapidly escalating outbreak has plateaued, and come down faster than would have been expected . Back of the envelope, it's hundreds of thousands of people in China that did not get Covid-19 because of this aggressive response.
Is the virus infecting almost everyone, as you would expect a novel flu to?
No - 75 to 80 percent of all clusters are in families. You get the odd ones in hospitals or restaurants or prisons, but the vast majority are in families. And only 5 to 15 percent of your close contacts develop disease.So they try to isolate you from your relatives as quickly as possible, and find everyone you had contact with in 48 hours before that .
You said different cities responded differently. How?
It depended on whether they had zero cases, sporadic ones, clusters or widespread transmission.
First, you have to make sure everyone knows the basics: hand-washing, masks, not shaking hands, what the symptoms are. Then, to find sporadic cases, they do fever checks everywhere, even stopping cars on highways to check everyone.
As soon as you find clusters, you shut schools, theaters, restaurants. Only Wuhan and the cities near it went into total lockdown.
How did the Chinese reorganize their medical response?
First, they moved 50 percent of all medical care online so people didn't come in. Have you ever tried to reach your doctor on Friday night? Instead, you contacted one online. If you needed prescriptions like insulin or heart medications, they could prescribe and deliver it.

But if you thought you had coronavirus?
You would be sent to a fever clinic. They would take your temperature, your symptoms, medical history, ask where you1d traveled, your contact with anyone infected. They'd whip you through a CT scan ...
Wait - "whip you through a CT scan"?
Each machine did maybe 200 a day. Five, 10 minutes a scan. Maybe even partial scans. A typical hospital in the West does one or two an hour. And not X-rays; they could come up normal, but a CT would show the "ground-glass opacities" they were looking for.
(Dr. Aylward was referring to lung abnormalities seen in coronavirus patients .)
And then?
If you were still a suspect case, you'd get swabbed . But a lot would be told, "You're not Covid." People would come in with colds, flu, runny noses. That's not Covid. If you look at the symptoms, 90 percent have fever, 70 percent have dry coughs, 30 percent have malaise, trouble breathing.Runny noses were only 4 percent.
The swab was for a PCR test, right? How fast could they do that? Until recently, we were sending all of ours to Atlanta.
They got it down to four hours.
So people weren't sent home?
No, they had to wait .You don1t want someone wandering around spreading virus.
If they wer e positive, what happened?
They'd be isolated. In Wuhan, in the beginning,it was 15 days from getting sick to hospitalization .They got it down to two days from symptoms to isolation.That meant a lot fewer infected - you choke off this thing's ability to find susceptibles .
What's the difference between isolation and hospitalization?

With mild symptoms, you go to an isolation center. They were set up in gymnasiums, stadiums - up to 1,000 beds. But if you were severe or critical, you1d go straight to hospitals.Anyone with other illnesses or over age 65 would also go straight to hospitals.
What were mild, severe and critical? We think of "mild" as like a minor cold.
No. "Mild" was a positive test, fever, cough - maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen. "Severe" was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. "Critical" was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.
So saying 80 percent of all cases are mild doesn't mean what we thought .
I'm Canadian. This is the Wayne Gretzky of viruses - people didn1t think it was big enough or fast enough to have the impact it does.

Hospitals were also separated?
Yes. The best hospitals were designated just for Covid, severe and critical. All elective surgeries were postponed. Patients were moved.Other hospitals were designated just for routine care: women still have to give birth, people still suffer trauma and heart attacks.
They built two new hospitals, and they rebuilt hospitals. If you had a long ward, they'd build a wall at the end with a window, so it was an isolation ward with "dirty" and "clean" zones. You'd go in, gown up, treat patients, and then go out the other way and de-gown . It was like an Ebola treatment unit, but without as much disinfection because it's not body fluids.
How good were the severe and critical care?
China is really good at keeping people alive. Its hospitals looked better than some Isee here in Switzerland. We'd ask, "How many ventilators do you have?" They'd say "SO." Wow! We'd say, "How many ECMOs?" They'd say "five." The team member from the Robert Koch Institute said, "Five? In Germany, you get three, maybe. And just in Berlin."

(ECMOs are extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, which oxygenate the blood when the
lungs fail.)
Who paid for all of this?
The government made it clear: testing is free. And if it was Covid-19, when your insurance ended, the state picked up everything .
In the U.S., that's a barrier to speed. People think: "If Isee my doctor, it's going to cost me $100. If I end up in the l.C.U., what's it going to cost me?" That'll kill you. That's what could wreak havoc. This is where universal health care coverage and security intersect. The U.S. has to think this through.
What about the nonmedical response?
It was nationwide. There was this tremendous sense of, "We've got to help Wuhan," not "Wuhan got us into this." Other provinces sent 40,000 medical workers, many of whom volunteered.
In Wuhan, our special train pulled in at night, and it was the saddest thing - the big intercity trains roar
right through, with the blinds down .
We got off, and another group did. Isaid, "Hang on a minute, Ithought we were the only ones allowed to get off." They had these little jackets and a flag - it was a medical team from Guangdong coming in to help.
How did people in Wuhan eat if they had to stay indoors?
Fifteen million people had to order food online. It was delivered. Yes, there were some screw-ups. But one woman said to me: "Every now and again there's something missing from a package, but Ihaven't lost any weight ."

Lots of government employees were reass igned?
From all over society .A highway worker might take temperatures, deliver food or become a contact tracer. In one hospital, I met the woman teaching people how to gown up. I asked, "You're the infection control expert?" No, she was a receptionist. She'd learned.

How did technology play a role?
They're managing massive amounts of data, because they're trying to trace every contact of 70,000 cases. When they closed the schools, really, just the buildings closed. The schooling moved online. Contact tracers had on-screen forms. If you made a mistake, it flashed yellow. It was idiot-proof.
We went to Sichuan, which is vast but rural. They'd rolled out SG. We were in the capital, at an emergency center with huge screens. They had a problem understanding one cluster. On one screen, they got the county headquarters. Still didn't solve it.
So they got the field team. Here's this poor team leader 500 kilometers away, and he gets a video call on his phone, and it's the governor .
What about social media?
They had Weibo and Tencent and WeChat giving out accurate information to all users. You could have Facebook and Twitter and lnstagram do that.
Isn't all of this impossible ih Amer ica?
Look, journalists are always saying: "Well, we can't do this in our country." There has to be a shift in mind-set to rapid response thinking.Are you just going to throw up your hands? There's a real moral hazard in that, a judgment call on what you think of your vulnerable populations.
Ask yourself: Can you do the easy stuff? Can you isolate 100 patients? Can you trace 1,000 contacts? If
you don't, this will roar through a community.
Isn't it possible only because China is an autocracy?
Journalists also say, "Well, they're only acting out of fear of the government," as if it's some evil fire­ breathing regime that eats babies. Italked to lots of people outside the system - in hotels, on trains, in the streets at night.
They're mobilized, like in a war, and it's fear of the virus that was driving them. They really saw
themselves as on the front lines of protecting the rest of China. And the world.

China is resta rting its economy now. How can it do that without creating a new wave of infections?
It's a "phased restart." It means different things in different provinces .
Some are keeping schools closed longer. Some are only letting factories that make things crucial to the supply chain open. For migrant workers who went home - well, Chengdu has 5 million migrant workers.
First,you have to see a doctor and get a certificate that you're "no risk." It's good for three days. Then you take the train to where you work. If it's Beijing, you then have to self-quarantine for two weeks.Your temperature is monitored, sometimes by phone, sometimes by physical check. What's going on with the treatment clinical trials?
They're double-blind trials, so I don't know the results. We should know more in a couple of weeks.
The biggest challenge was enrolling people. The number of severe patients is dropping, and there's competition for them .And every ward is run by a team from another province, so you have to negotiate with each one, make sure they're doing the protocols right.
And there are 200 trials registered - too many. Itold them: "You've got to prioritize things that have promising antiviral properties."
And they're testing traditional medicines?
Yes, but it's a few standard formulations. It's not some guy sitting at the end of the bed cooking up herbs. They think they have some fever-reducing or anti-inflammatory properties. Not antivirals, but it makes people feel better because they're used to it.
What did you do to protect yourself?
A heap of hand-sanitizer. We wore masks, because it was government policy. We didn't meet patients or contacts of patients or go into hospital dirty zones.
And we were socially distant. We sat one per row on the bus. We ate meals in our hotel rooms or else one person per table. In conference rooms, we sat one per table and used microphones or shouted at each other.
That's why I'm so hoarse. But Iwas tested, and I know I don't have Covid.

Subject: Emergency Prepared ness, Coronavirus, and Products from MPI

Hi Anthony Fauci,


I know you're busy, but I wanted to introduce our Company, Medical Partners International, and talk for a quick minute about what we do and how it can help you. As you know, the CDC has asked all healthcare facilities to prepare for the "worst case scenario" around the Novel Coronavirus. As much of our medical supply manufacturing in the US comes from overseas, it is of critical import to look  at potential shortages of key products that will be needed to perfonn basic IP functions in your facility . We have already seen challenges with N95 masks, and I have heard about potential shortages of items like disinfection wipes.  We at MPI have a couple of unique solutions you need to consider:


PureTabs and PureOne NaDCC tablets that are diluted in tap water to create HOCl for surface disinfection. They are currently used in electrostatic sprayers to offer greater coverage around your equipment. If, for some reason, there's a challenge getting the electrostatic sprayers in the future (and we've already seen shortages and delays in getting new units), simply use our NaDCC tablets with spray bottles from your local store to apply the HOCl for disinfection. Our tablets have kill claims for C. diff in four minutes, and like a number of other cleaning agents, we believe we can be effective against the Novel Coronavirus . The problem with the other products  out there comes down to availability , particularly of the N95 masks that are required on their IFU's. With our product, an N95 mask is recommended, but not required, which is a huge distinction  if you have run out ofN95 masks.


Secondly, we have our protective scn1bs, lab coats and privacy curtains from Prime Medical. Co-branded with Clorox, these  products create a 3 log  (99.9%)  barrier against bacteria and viruses when washed with bleach.  The barrier lasts for 12 weeks ,

so there's a dramatically lower chance of passing something along. These are a great protective measure for your staff. The CDC mentioned that sodium hypochlorite (bleach) may be effective against Nove l Coronavirus, so it stands to reason that our scrubs will help against unwanted spreading as well.


Finally, we have our Path-0-Wrap , which protects mattresses and gurneys from the harsh chemicals used during cleaning. It also can help dramatically when a catastrophic event happens, as you simply put these on a gurney or mattres s and remove them between patients. It was invented by an EMT for just this purpose, and may be exactly what you need for your Emergency Preparedness Program.


We also have other great IP products such as:

 UV Disinfection Boxes to create a "touch-less check-in" to protect staff and patients alike
 HealthySole UV solutions for the bottom of feet for OR and other sensitive areas
 Bowman Cover Your Cough Stations
Ihave attached a couple of brochures for your review. We can provide you with a quote, or have our local representative bring in samples of some of the products to show. Simply write me back with what you would like more information on. We feel our products will make a difference for your facility let us know how we can help.



Sincerely,


Medical Partners International

Subject: Meeting to Assess Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for risk of enhanced disease Dear Doctor  Fauci,
I am writing to you as a member of the SPEAC project which CEPI has funded to assist with the evaluation of the safety of vaccines in their portfolio.  As part of this effort, we are assisting with developing preclinical and clinical testing criteria to evaluate the risk of enhanced disease following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine candidates.  As you know, this had been an issue with some prior SARS vaccine candidates.

We are convening a two day virtual meeting of experts via video conference next week on March 12 and 13 between 8 am and 1pm Eastern time each day.   Participants in the meeting are shown in the attached agenda but include Paul Henri Lambert from Geneva and Barney Graham from NIH. The meeting will actively involve the participants on the agenda the first day and on the second day the meeting will be open for several peer reviewers including Stanley Plotkin and Andy Pollard to review and comment on possible small and NHP animal models as well as appropriate immunologic test ing to be done in early phase one trials.

Iam wanted to make you aware of the meeting so that you could attend all or part as an observer if you wish but also to invite you to consider joining on day two as one of our formal peer reviewers.  The goal of the meeting would be to share recommendations with CEPI COVID-19 developers as well as other interested parties.

Any comments you have on the agenda or draft questions for consideration would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Abstract
Background: Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVI0-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVI0-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVI0-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status

prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation : Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVI0- 19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.

Subject: Re: 2019-nCoV Testing for Public Health Labs


Tony:


Iam loath to contact you given that Iam sure you are overwhelmed. However, we are now being contacted by sources at tertiary academic hospitals with CUA-high complexity clinical labs who are alarmed about their inability to scale up SARS-CoV2 qRT-PCR testing in their facilities in the time frame they feel is neccesary, even after Saturday's FDA regulatory guidance and the availabi lity of Integrated DNA Techno logy's testing reagents. (An example of such an email is below.) Iam passing this along with the hopes that if you can do something about it, you wil l. From an email:


"We have experience bringing up laboratory developed tests. We have never submitted an EUA before. For our current LDTs.they are typically for pathogens that we have some experience with, positive clinical samples are readily available, and/or appropriate control material s (e.g. bacteria, viral genomes) are readily commercially available. None of those are true for SARS-CoV2. There is tremendous concern about deploying a suboptima l test into a challenging envirom11ent.




The EUA guidance from FDA is not unreasonable for the validat ion of a new respiratory virus test, and it gives an accurate picture of the amount of testing that is required to bring on a new test by the lab. Federal law requires us to perform accuracy, reproducibi lity, analytical sensitivity I LOD, and analytical specificity (cross reactivity) studies. Those studies require positive control material includingintact vi ru s or RNA. Clinical labs are not prepared to generate RNA transcript, and we don't usually source these ourselves. We  can't get the vims without filling out extensive paperwork that requires multiple
signatures. Getting control material for va lidation one of the biggest issues.

Prior to the EUA change, the calculus for our labs was that it would take 3 to 4 weeks to actually validate a test, and then we would  submit  to the FDA for EUA (a process none of us has ever done), and then  we would wait for the FDA to respond  (hopefully  in the affirmative).  I think we all expected the FDA  EUA review  to be at least 4 weeks. Based on that time-line, many commercial vendors would have reagents available with their own EUAs that would be able to be performed on large automated instruments including potentially STAT. None of the LDT assays (or CDC assay) can be performed STAT or on demand.




With the EUA change, the process to validate  the test is still the same and will still take  3 or more  weeks.  Once validated,  we can perform  clinical testing (like any other LDT)  wh ile we submit the EUA. This would likely allow us to begin testing several weeks before commercial vendors have EUA reagents available based upon our best current
infonnation. Most of us expect to transition a commercial EUA at some point.




The recent  statement that  IDT reagents can be used under  the EUA from CDC is misleading.  It applies to a very limited number  of lots (currently  l , likely 2 soon), it assumes reagents  are available, and it requires strict adherence to the CDC protocol using identical extraction methods (2 choices) and amplification / detection methods (1 instrument). It still specifies the use of an NI, N2, and N3 reactions, but CDC has dropped the N3 reaction. The EUA has not yet been updated. Neither of our hospitals have the complete  extract ion   or amplification  instruments  so we have to do the  EUA anyway."




Hope you are coping ok, James

I hope this email finds you well. Over the past 48 hours, PrEP4All has received multiple requests from leaders of public health departments and public health practitioners to begin publicly pressuring

CDC/HHS to ensure that properly equipped public health labs (besides CDC's lab in Atlanta) can perform real time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) testing for 2019 Novel-Coronavirus (2019- nCoV).

Our understanding is that given the public health emergency declared by HHS, an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA is required for public health labs to perform their own lab developed test for 2019-nCoV, even if it is using the CDCs published qRT-PCR protocol and primer/probe sequences (
https://www .cdc .gov/coronavirus/20 19-ncov/downloads/rt -pcr-panel-for-detection-instructions.pdf
)
,and the lab is capable of handling BSL3+ samples.


We understand the extreme delicateness of this situation, and also that it is outside of our normal wheelhouse . But given the concerns of our colleagues in the public health sector,we thought it was important to give you a heads up regarding this request .

Let us know if there is anyway we can help. Sincerely,
James  Krellenstein

Dear Dr Fauci, this is not an area of my expertise, but given the urgency of situation with the Covid-19 and some of our experiences with treating CART induced cytokine release syndrome in cancer patients, just wanted to share this email with you in case you find it of interest. Dr Betts is my brilliant junior BMT colleague at University of Minnesota .I realize this may be old news to you but wanted to share just in case.
Warm regards

Subject:Covid-19 ca uses CRS (and source of mortality) Hi Steve,
This is an interesting paper from intensivists in Wuhan . The IF of the journal is 18 too.


Looks like covid-19 causes an IL-6 mediated CRS with myocarditis, which is associated with mortality (more so than the pneumonitis).

This suggests we should be more concerned with getting tocilizumab for critically ill covid-19 patients, rather than tamiflu and ARVT...

Do you have a friend at the CDC that could use this info? Thanks, Brian

I know the demands on you have skyrocketed, so I am circling back to confirm you are still
available on Friday March 20 for the COVID- 19 event, and also to seek your advice, as we amend the layout of the event, including possibly having it run a little longer.

Iam still hoping you can do a big picture scene setter {15-20  minutes with slides)


(i) The state of the science surrounding the virus, what we know and do not know,
(ii) Progression of the outbreak
{iii)	Testing
(iv)	Status of accelerated early work on vaccines, antivirals



We will have a panel that covers China, and we may add a panel on the epicenters in Italy,
ROK, Iran


I would like to carve out ample space for discussion of the United States. In your view, is it advisable to put a request forward to Secy Azar or VP Pence? Neither needs a platform to have their voices heard. But perhaps they would see this sort of setting as an opportunity. If not the Secy or VP, is there anyone else you might propose? I had reached out earlier to Steve Biegun to speak on the foreign policy dimensions, especially regarding China, but have not heard back.

I have separately reached out to the NGA about possibly enlisting a governor to speak.

If you are free and wish to speak by phone about any of this, please let me know. Best of luck with everything. You seem to be making progress!
Best Steve

Hi Tony,
just a short notice to tell you that you are becoming even more popular in Italy as your face and
interviews are everywhere on the main Italian broadcasting news and journals .
It seems like to be in USA again for me, as I see you every day and Ican tell you are doing well although you must be overwhelmed with all this. I was supposed to be at NIH in tre weeks from now,but I have cancelled the flight and travel due to highest restrictions from CDC and HHS for Italian travellers from Lombardia and Veneto (and I live in Milan).
Can we estimate how long all this will last? Weeks or months according to you knowledge?


Hope to see you soon anyway and I really hope U.S. outbreak will not turn as bad as the Italian one. Indeed, Milan is living a real unprecedented (for modern time) and surrealistic situation with a mix of fear, panic and incredulity among people. It almost seems a movie! The government shut down half country by closing all schools and universities, by not allowing meetings of any kind, by limiting travels in many places and by placing severe restrictions in social life. They even stopped the Fashion week in Milan that is a big thing here.
Maybe too late, but they didi it and we hope it will work somehow to reach a plateau in contagious.


have a nice day

Good morning! I made contact and it's in the works! We even have them in our 20/20 special tomorrow  night!

Question: do you think you could go Iive with me from NIH or WH one day next week for our Noon Coronavirus show? it's live steamed so we have millions of viewers. We wou ld take viewer questions (1would give you ahead of time) and you would answer only those you want to.
It's a half hour show , but we would do whatever amount of time your schedule allows.
It would be so impactful for the average viewer.

"Means of spread A study from AMA confirmed many of the parameters assumed in our models:

A few things Iwant to highlight --


1. Means of spread A study from AMA confirmed many of the parameters assumed in our models:
- A 20-year old infected wit h COVID-19 left Wuhan and went on infecting 5 relatives. When
they tested positive,she was finally isolated,but tested negative still,and later tested positive, and remain normal on chest CT with no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms
{cough or sore throat as late as Fen 11(time of the papert study duration).


So spreading and its wide scope is unavoidable because there exists these very healthy individuals who can spread effectively -- even during incubation period -- while they remain perfectly healthy. It also showcases difficulty in testing -- negative test -- may not be the end of it.


2. Iranian cases, though mysterious since the origin was not traced to China, may very well show that COVID-19 virus is very adaptable and mutating rapidly.

3. Long recovery The long recovery period is troubesome and must be taken seriously by health providers as they prepare for hospitalization. Therei snot much surge capacity in hospitals. So they must be innoative in the staggering process and isolation is of paramount importance. Government/Local should be readied for supplementing medical tents outside hospitals when needed (clearly extra staff too) .

4. Citizes' view Iwas traveling so I did a real-time on-the-road analysis of human behavior and anxiety level. I overheard many people
-- (a) asked when CDC would tell us more on what to do.
-- (b) wish they could pull their kids out of school but there is no such option as part of the
preventive measure (not announced by CDC).
 -- (c) wish CDC would recommend tele-work options so they don't have to travel and expose themselves and their family to unneccessary risk.
-- (d) have no clue what the government is doing to keep the risk low as it is now.What
exactly is being implemented to keep it low.


5. Resource-limited countries Ipray that it would not reach the resource -limited countries like many in Africa (though it seems unavoidable). Icannot imagine the consequence.

6. What we must do: We must leverage the knowledge from other countries to better prepare ourselves . Japan's Crusis shows the importance of TIMELY proper isolation and STRATEG IC operations logistics in testing and in quarantine . South Korea (contrasting with Hong Kong, Singapore) demonstrates critica l importance of EARLY social distancing and  high compliance community NPI intervention . China's latest lockdown of 1/2 billion people truly signifies that gravity and unchartered terrority of this virus. No country would take to such extreme mea·sure.

7. CFR Since over 90% of influenza is never recorded/known, this COVID-19 seems to fall into similar spirit now, with so many cases of asymptomtic and transmission while incubating. While the true CFR remains unknown, the CFR of tested positive cases should offer a good comparison to the CFR of tested positive flu cases. That gives us a clearer estimate of health-resource burden.

Roundup this morning.



Singapore and Hong Kong are holding steady-both have implemented NPis pretty early and have good surveillance .




Things are really accelerating in South Korea. Case count increased to
433 with 2 deaths.

Report below of COVID hitting Samsung's mobile device factory, which has now been shut down. This is what will happen here. The greatest concern is what this would mean for critical infrastructure sectors (including components of our healthcare system), The strategies I outlined for outpatient clinics could be used by business (most especially CI sectors) to maintain business continuity. It is as simple as the old saying, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket."  It is both contingency planning (continuity of operations/continuity of business) and application of NPis!fLC (especially social distancing in the community supported by home isolation and home quarantine).

We now have COVID in several countries across the ME (Iran, Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, UAE) .  We added Iran the day before yesterday and 3 countries yesterday (Israel, Egypt and Lebanon).  Iran already appears to have a well established outbreak that will be tough to slow down given  the estimated size with 5 deaths already (that is where Wuhan was by Jan-20).  Japan is also seeing acceleration with local transmission  (119 cases).

Italy is another area to watch.

"And unfortunately, what the experts feared since yesterday has occurred, when it was discovered that two patients had been hospitalized for about ten days at the Schiavonia hospital (Padua) without knowing that they had contracted the Coronavirus: since yesterday evening everyone those who attended the hospital were subjected to a swab to detect any infections, and the examination gave positive results in numerous cases. It means that there are other people, probably among those who attended the ward where two patients were hospitalized, who are now positive for the virus and consequently could in turn have spread the infection. Already yesterday evening the Governor of Veneto Luca Zaia ordered the progressive
evacuation of the Padua hospital which should take place within 5-6 days."

''The hospital is surrounded by a 'sanitary cordon', with Carabinieri, workers of the Red Cross and Civil Protection. Cardiology chief Giampaolo Pasquetto aITived outside the hospital for a few minutes and reported the results of the swabs 'as far as I have been able to know from my colleagues so far,' he said. The modern structure is located between the towns ofEste and Monselice and was recently inaugurated to serve the Eu ganean Hills area."

https://www .reuters.com/ article/us-china-health-southkorea -samsung­ elec/samsung-electronics  -confirms-corona virus-case-at-phone-factory­ complex-in-south-korea-idUSKCN20GOCG

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics said on Saturday that one coronavirus case had been confirmed at its mobile device factory complex in the southeastern city of Gumi, causing a shutdown of its entire facility there until Monday morning.

Samsung Electronics, the world 's top sma1tphone maker, said the floor where the infected employee worked would be shut down until the morning of Feb. 25.

"The company has placed colleagues who came in contact with the infected employee in self-qu arantine and taken steps to have them tested for possible infection," Samsung said in a news release.

Samsung's factory in Gurni accounts for a small portion of its total smartphone production, and it makes high-end phones, mostly for the domestic market. Samsung produces most of its smaitphones in Vietnam and India.

Gumi is close to the city of Daegu, home to a church at the center of
South Korea's largest coronavirus outbreak.

South Korea said on Saturday that the number of people infected with
the coronavirus in the country had more than doubled to 433.

Samsung said production at its chip and display factories in other parts
of South Korea would not be affected.

Wuhan to add  19 additiona l hospital (when combined with the other 3
hospitals, this would add 30,000 beds). Just to put that inperspective .
 There are 2.8 hospital beds in the US per 1,000 population.
 30,000 beds is about the number of beds we would have for a population of  11M.




When you add the 30,000 beds plus the 13,348 other beds added (total
of 43,300 beds)

 There are 4.5 hospital beds in China per 1,000 population
 43,300 beds is about the number of beds in China for a populat ion of
9.6 M
 Wuhan will have nearly doubled its bed capacity




How hard wou ld that be for us to double bed capacity in any major US
city? (Really isolation beds for mild illness)

WUHAN (XINHUA)- Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, plans to build  another 19makeshift hospitals to receive more infected patients, local authorities said Friday (Feb 21).

Upon their completion, all the makeshift hospitals in Wuhan are expected to offer 30,000 beds on Feb 25, said Mr Hu Yabo, deputy mayor of Wuhan at a press briefing on epidemic prevention and control.

To date, Wuhan has converted 13 existing venues into temporary hospitals, with a total of 13,348 beds, and about 9,313 beds have been put into use to treat patient s with mild symptoms, said Mr Hu.

On a totally different note.  Others have been plying with and modifying  the notional conops for a healthcare system.




l set up some simple rules:

1. Protect uninfected patients and staff from infectious patients and staff (using all the tools that we have including home isolation and home quarantine, cohorting/physical separation, PPE, telehealth, etc.)
2. Provide acute care for COVID patients (continuum of ER-inpatient care-intensive care)
3. Support mildly ill COVID patients in home isolation--telehealth
4. Support patients in voluntary home quarantine --telehealth

5. Continue to address the usual mix of healthcare needs for patients (from outpatient care to acute care to mental health care to long term care)

a. Outpatient clinics and providers focus on wellness to minimize ER visits/hospitalization  to unburden the acute care system-leverage  telehealth
b. Continue to provide acute care and inpatient mental health care (continuum of ER-inpatient care-intensive care) for non­
COVID conditions
c. Protect high-risk patients in residential/long term care (nursing homes, hospice, long term psychiatry, etc.)




The notional conops divides the healthcare system into hot and safe areas.  The hot area is  only acute care: ER-acute inpatient care-ICU care.  The safe areas include a separate acute care area (ER-acute inpatient care-ICU care), all the outpatient clinics/care, other inpatient care areas such as mental health, as well as long term/residential care (nursing home, hospice, long term psychiatry,  etc.).




Triage will not be easy (between hot and safe).  Best I could come up with would be: (1) anyone already on home isolation or home
quarantine (may need a medical record flag); (2) anyone with ILI (could
narrow that down with a negative rapid flu test); (3) anyone with a sick household member with suspected COVID.  Could be very difficult for an unconscious /confused, or trauma patient etc., but would  probably err on the side of hot and think of additional layered strategies to minimize patient risk within that area (private rooms, patient PPE?).  Triage would need to err on the side of keeping the safe area safe.




The mitigation measures are our best tools to reduce community transmission and reduce the probability of an infectious patient getting into a safe area. If we have a breach in a safe inpatient area, it pretty much converts that inpatient area into a hot area. That also means that we have the staff in that area exposed (because oflimited availability of PPE, the staff in the safe area would not be PPE-PPE would have been directed to the staff in the hot area). Those staff would likely need to be placed on quarantine. The effect is we now have a much larger hot area with even fewer staff. That would really be a mess.

You have the same problem in the outpatient areas.  Have a sick  patient slip through and come in contact with a number of the clinic staff  (not in PPE), and we now need to quarantine all those staff   In contrast to a breach for the inpatient area, the outpatient area can still operate as a safe area (just minus those staff who would now be on quarantine).  But do that a few times and pretty soon you have nobody left to fight.  One way I thought about dealing with this scenario is to take the outpatient staff and split them in two.  One group works the clinic (physically present) for the usual clinic hours for a 14 day stretch (1 incubation period).  Another group works from home (and practices social distancing, etc., really acting as if they are on home quarantine) and leverages telehealth technology to care for patients and help with monitoring those patients in home isolation and home quarantine. After 14 days the groups switch. [All along we monitor employees daily (whether at work or at home) for symptoms or sick household
members]  Inthe event of a breach, the groups immediately switch and the group that was working is placed on actual home quarantine (but still continues to work from home leveraging telehealth) . That way if a
breach does happen, we have a fallback response (that we are constantly
pract icing) that allows us to sustain outpatient care.




For the inpatient areas, I thought about the lone survivor model (holding back 1 Secretary and staff in the event that the government is decapitated).   So think of a small group (would need to think thru what the composition of that team would look like for each area (acute care, inpatient mental health,  long term care) that would at least provide the nucleus of the expertise necessary to reconstitute the service in the
event of a major breach). This smaller group would vary in team
members every 2 weeks and would rotate to work from home for 14 days stretches and practice social distancing (acting as if they were on home quarantine). They could also assist via telehealth (inpatient consultation, etc., while out of the hospital).




Is anyone thinking along these lines (really continuity of operations for
the healthcare system)?

China has again modified its reporting (first it added clinical cases to
lab confirmed cases on Feb-12).  Now it is subtracting out those clinical
cases and limiting numbers to lab confirmed). Have continued to
follow the hospitalization data from Hubei (see below).

Here is the data being reported by Hubei and Wuhan. Data is pretty sketchy prior to Jan-21.

More on South Korea (sounds just like what happened at Jefferson Barracks , just outside St. Louis, in 1918, armed with the exact same tools they had more than 100 years ago to control an outbreak). I assume they must also be taking measures within the base to limit spread (keeping infectious individuals apart from those not yet infected with isolation and quarantine and social distancing).

SEOUL, Feb. 21 (Yonhap)--The  military is making all-out efforts to prevent the new coronavirus from spreading further into the barracks, officials said Friday, after the country's first infections in the am1ed forces were confirmed.

Earlier in the day, a Navy sailor on the southern island of Jeju was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 in the first such case among service   ersonnel here.

Following the confirmation, the Navy has checked the temperature of
all personnel at the base where the infected sailor served and
quarantined all those who had contacts w ith the person, it said.

"We have caITied out disinfection work at the base and are devoting all our efforts to preventing the spread of the new virus," the Navy said in a release.

An officer each from the Army and the Air Force were also confirm ed
to have the virus the same day.

The military is now working to identify personnel who have visited the southeastern city of Daegu and the surround ing North Gyeongsang Province since Feb. 10, as these areas have recently seen a surge .in the number of infected people.

More than 5,000 service personnel are estimated to have visited the region dur ing their vacation according to the m ilitary's preliminary investi gation .

On Thursday night_, the defense ministry said all personnel will be ban-ed from vacationing, staying outside their bases and meeting visitors starting Saturday.

The decision was made at a meeting of top defense officials presided over by Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, during which he called for "extraord inary measures" to contain th e s read of th e virus.

Amid growing fears over the disease, the government called off a
planned ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of a pro-democracy movement in Daegu, which was designated a "special care zone" over the virus earlier in the day.

S. Korea reports 52 new virus
cases, total now at 156


Welfare /Medicine 10:37 February 21, 2020

SEOUL, Feb. 2 1 (Yonhap)-- South Korea reported 52 new cases of th e new coronaviru s Friday, bringing the total number of infections in the nation to 156, with the potentially fatal illness spreading fast across the country.

The number of COVID- 19 infections here has almost tripled in ju st three days, with most new infections traced to church services in the sou theastern city of Daegu .

Of the 52 new cases, 41 are in Daegu, 300 ki l om eters southeast of Seoul, and the neighboring North Gyeongsang Province. Another three were reported in Seoul, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.

Tour buses are parked at a logistics terminal in Daegu, 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, on Feb. 20, 2020. Thirty-eight new coronavirus cases were reported in the city on Feb. 21, 2010. (Yonhap)

The spike of infections in Daegu and severa l cases in Seoul, where routes of infections are not immediately traceable, have prompted health officials to declare that COVID-19 has begun spreading locally.

The KCDC sajd two new cases were reported in South Gyeongsang Prov ince. Ina sign that the virus may broadly spread nationwide, six provinces, includ ing Gyeonggi, Jeju , Chungcheong and North Jolla, each reported one case.

Of the 52 new cases, 39 ate linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu , where the 3 lst patient, the country's probable "super spreader," attended worship services, the KCDC said.

A 61-year-old South Korean woman, who tested positive for the virus earlier this week, attended worship services at the church on Feb. 9 and this past Sunday.

KCDC Director Jung Eun-kyeong told reporters Thursday that the agency is uncertain whether the woman , known as the 31st patient, was a "super spreader" of the virus but asked  1,001 members of the church to self-isolate to  stem the spread of the virus.

The government  decided  to designate Daegu  and  neighboring  Cheongdo as "special management zones," following the spike in the number of infected people and the nation's first death from the virus .

From Feb-15 to Feb-20 the number of confirmed cases increased from 355 to 634 (increase of 279). The number of asymptomat ics increased from  73 to 322 (increase of249).   So from Feb-15  to Feb-20, 249 of the

279 confirmed cases (89%) were asymptomatic.  Seems a little odd. Also, read reports that all passengers and crew have beem tested (but reports only note that 3,066 of the 3,711 have been tested) .

This is new

 Now 634 cases confirmed on the cruise ship (3,063 tested) (so not all the ship and crew have been tested 3.711)
 Slightly more than half are asymptomatic (previously we heard that
73 of 355 are asymptomatic)
 28 in serious condition (4.4%)

Japan's Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told Parliament the two people from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who died bad "received the best medica l treatment"  but couldn't be saved  after catching the novel coronavirus on board.  As  of Thursday , 634 passengers  and  crew members  were diagnosed with  the virus out of 3,063 tested.  Slightly more than half have no symptoms at all, officials said, and many of the remainder have only mild fever or a cough. Among patients who tested positive for the virus, 28 were reported  in serious condition Thursday.

Doctors have said the virus can be particularly harmful in elderly patients, and one of the two fatal cases from the Diamond Princess, a Japanese man in his 80s, had pre-existing bronchial asthma and had
been treated for angina.  The  other, a Japanese woman  in her  80s without underlying illnesses, came down with a fever on Feb. 5, the same day passengers were told they would be quarantined in their cabins for two
weeks, according to health ministry officials. The next day, she started
suffering from diaIThea and saw a doctor on board.

She wasn't  taken to a hospital unti1 Feb.  12 when she started  suffering shortness of breath. Her virus test came back posi tive the following day, and despite treatment with antiviral drugs normally used to treat HN infection, she died Thursday.

Asked about the woman 's case, health ministry official Hiroshi Umeda said, "I believe it was handled promptly." He said the ship was a difficult environment  for medical staff but they  worked  day and night and  tried to prioritize the most serious cases.

Keep an eye on South Korea too.  Seeing rapid growth in cases in South
Korea (see story below)

South Korea now reporting 104 cases and 1death today. South Korea now implementing NPis.  This story is eerily reminiscent of the actions taken at Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis in 1918.




Also attached are update for Singapore (85 cases; 46 in hospital/4 in ICU; 4 kids, only l in hospital) and Hong Kong (69 cases, still no kids reported). Both have implemented NPis (small increases in cases today).  Japan has report ed 10 new cases today-total now is 94.

SEOUL, South Korea - South Korea reported its first coronavirus-linked death Thursday, while the U.S. military tightened restrictions on travel to the southeastern city of Daegu due to an outbreak in infections in the area .

Daegu also urged residents to stay home as the city of 2.5 million people and surrounding areas struggled to contain an outbreak of the pneumonia-like  disease.

The Anny garrison in Daegu also restricted access and announced that schools and nonessential business would be closed for a second day on F1iday.

In an exception to policy, U.S. service members were authorized to wear face masks in uniform "regardless of air quality conditions," according to the ganison's Facebook page.

Fast-moving developments this week were a blow to South Korea's
hope that the crisis was easing.

Instead, dozens of new cases were confirmed in recent days, with the total number of infections soaring to 104 on Thmsday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

U.S. Forces Korea said, "there remains zero confirmed cases ofUSFK
personnel with COVID-19."

The virus first appeared in December in Wuhan, China, and spread to nearly 30 countries. More than 2,000 people have died -most in mainland China.

A South Korean man in his 60s died Wednesday at a hospital in the southeastern city of Cheongdo and posthumously tested positive for the virus, the KCDC said Thursday. Itwas South Korea's first death from the virus.




USFK raised the risk level for the military communit y to moderate on Wednesday and banned all nonessential travel to Daegu due to an outbreak linked to a church near the Army garrison in the city.

On Thursday, USFK added that all travel by American troops to, from and around Daegu requires authorization from their leadership. The precaution was "highly encouraged" for all family members, civilians and contractors as well.

"All off-installation travel for all USFK populations should be minimized to reduce potential contamination," USFK announced on its website.

U.S. Army Garrison Daegu, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, also said visitors not performing mission essential or official business would be denied access as it implemented health checks at the gates.

Nonessen tial personnel were not required to go to work on Friday and most activities would be suspended, including the schools, it said.

The garrison also recommen ded that members of the military community avoid public places and transportat ion in the city, including

stores, restaurants and other heavily congested areas until the situation
is brought under control.

Self-quarant ine measures were ordered for any American troops who had visited the affected New World Church, but garrison commander Col. Edward Ballanco said earlier Thursday that no Ame.deans were known to have done so.

He also urged Americans to avoid a local hospital where the woman
believed to have been a carrier was treated.

The garrison also lifted limits on wearing face masks for American troops in uniform, who normally are only allowed to wear them on days with extreme pollution.

Last thing.  Keep a very close eye on Japan.  The outbreak is starting to take off there with numbers of cases scattered across the country with no link to known cases. We are also seeing nosocomial transmission (a
number of healthcare workers infected). There is also a large number of cases hospitalized in Japan related to the cruise ship, and now the
release oflarge numbers of passengers from the cruise ship into the
community. Yesterday they reported a total of 84 cases-caught up to

Singapore.  But unlike Singapore, Japan has been slow to implement NPis.  The other concern  is that Japan's popu lation is
disproportionately aged (it has the highest% age 65 of any country). In Japan, 27% of the population is :::, 65; inthe US, 15.6% of the population is 2:. 65. And Japan can also claim the largest city in the world (metro Tokyo with 38 M people-pretty much the population of California crammed into an area smaller than the size of Connecticut).
 Japan also has the 10th largest city in the world (Osaka with 19 M people).

What has me worried is what happened on the cruise ship is a preview of what will happen when this virus makes its way to the US healthcare system   (not to mention institutionalized high-risk populations in the US, like nursing homes) . I'm not sure that folks understand what is just over the horizon .




Remember the story about Mann Gulch? We are at the equivalent of about 5:44. I anticipate that when we reach 5:45, there is going to be chaos and panic to get anything in place.  I doubt that what we would

then hurriedly put in place will be any better than what they did on that cruise ship. As a consequence, would expect much the same results.




I listened to the discussion yesterday. After listening to James and Michael describe the conditions on and around the cruise ship, I wondered whether anyone in healthcare leadership (outside the expertise at our biocontainment facilities) is thinking about infection control practices for any staff entering areas of a hospital caring for COVID patients (like changing clothes before entering and perhaps wearing scrubs, not bringing personal items into the area like iphones, ipads, stethoscopes, white coats, purses, briefcases, etc.)? And instituting policies that require all patients to phone for clearance to enter prior to presenting at safe acute and non-acute areas including community based clinics? Are we confident of the infection control practices of acute care staff (that they know the basics of how to don and doff PPE and behavior while in PPE?) Would HCWs inoutpatient clinics or long term care facilities be any better prepared than the crew on board the cruise ship or the responders in Japan? I'm no expert in infection control and would defer to the expertise in this group. I was just a little surprised how little this seemed to be a concern for the healthcare leaders gathered yesterday.




I think we are getting close to the point where we need to drop those things that are not critical and focus on the most important things.




We are going to have a devil of time with lab confirmation-it is just too slow (they had a 2 day turnaround on the cruise ship) and we just don't have the capacity for the volume of tests we would anticipate. Charity has stressed this point again and again. That means we are going to have to fly blind early on. Perhaps the best we are going to be able to do in the near term if things begin to accelerate is screen all suspect cases (pretty much anyone with ILI symptoms) with a quick flu test and assume anyone who tests negative is suspected COVID until proven otherwise; and treat everyone who tests positive with Tamiflu.  It will prove problematic early on, but as the epidemic barrels along, COVID will displace everything (at that point we will just assume that anyone with a fever or ILI has COVID). The problem is in the beginning . It is going to be so hard to sort things out. Matt, James and others are pushing for more rapid screening-but we just aren't there yet. The consequence is that we will be placing patients with resp illness (that is not flu and presumed to be COVID) in areas with actual

COYID patients. I hate to do that, but not sure how it could be avoided early on.  But we would only do that for those who are ill enough to be hospitalized.  The large number of asymptomatic and mildly ill patients would be under home isolation (so no worries about mixing confirmed and suspected patients). The downside is that we would have larger number of people is isolation and home quarantine than is really necessary (and the consequence of increased workplace absenteeism).




And it is because home isolation and home quarantine are so important, healthcare systems (and not ju st public health) have to grab a hold of operationalizing those NPls with both hands. A while back, I created some prescriptions (tongue incheek), just to underscore that physicians do have a role in isolation and quarantine (it is not limited to public health). We might not have pharmaceuticals available to treat COVID, but why can't we write prescriptions for non-pharmaceutical s? I don't think healthcare leaders appreciate this point.  Every COVID patient we admit or see in the ER will require us to follow up with household members to make sme they know to home quarantine (need to do the same anywhere in our system we find a patient who is infected). You could not imagine the pushbackIhave received when 1 proposed that    we must have an active role-people seem to think that state and local public health is alone responsible for this. I would think public health will be overwhelmed and taking charge of this is our best strategy to keep our safe areas safe.




l would be interested to hear how other healthcare systems and public
health leaders are thinking about this.

Keeping track of the outbreak aboard the cruise ship.  The latest update is the announcement of 2 deaths (both patients in their 80s).  An 87- year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, died on the 20th.  Both were Japanese (the 87-year-old man was hospitalized on Feb-11 and the 84- year-old women on Feb-12) .  So time to death from recognition of
infection was 8-9 days.  On Feb-12, the total number of confirmed cases
was 203. So estimated CFR back dating the denominator to Feb-12 is 1%. Assuming a denominator of 621, the CFR is 0.3%. if deaths are lagging by 8-10 days (and confirmed cases plateau), we should have a pretty good estimate of CFR for he entire group in another week or so. Will need to peel off the number of cases involving the crew member to get a better estimate of CFR in the elderly. These numbers are within
the range we have been estimating.




The 2,666 passengers are sin1ilar in age (and likely in co-morbidities) to the population we see in a nursing home or residential care facility. The 1,045 crew are a proxy for a young healthy populat ion . It will be important to look at the outcomes separately. One of the concerns is how a 'remake of this movie' could play out in similarly confined populations of elderly frail Americans. Here are the numbers oflong term care facilities/programs in the US that care for the frail elderly. A large number of locations and a large number of residents/participants. I know that healthcare leaders were engaged yesterday, is anyone engaging this sector (long term care)? The healthcare leaders seemed more concerned about critical supply shortages (akin to the IV fluid shortage). Listening to them, it felt like their concerns seemed almost divorced from the threat ofCOVID.

New virus cruise ship disembarks and kills two Japanese passengers in hospital

February 20, 2020 11:38


Two Japanese men and women in their 80s who were hospitalized and treated for the virus were killed on the 20th in a cruise ship passenger who was confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus .This is the first time a cruise ship passenger has died and three people have been killed in the country .

As of the 19th, 621 cruise ships out of approximately 3,700 crew members and passengers on the cruise ship where outbreaks of the new coronavirus were confirmed were confirmed.

According to government officials, two of them, a 87-year-old man and an 84- year-old woman, died on the 20th.

Both were Japanese and had a basic illness and were confirmed to have been infected with the virus, so it was said that men were hospitalized on the 11th of this month and women on the 12th to be treated.

This is the first time a cruise ship passenger has died.


In addit ion, three people have been killed in Japan, following the death of a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa Prefecture on the 13th of this month.

Australian cruise passengers arrive to Darwin after Diamond Princess virus outbreak ordeal

Feb 20

A rescue mission of Australian cruise ship passengers from Japan has officially landed in Darwin, but the flight wasn't free from drama.

Thousands of people sharing toilets, pools and buffets - is this the petri dish of the sea?

The Qantas coronavirus rescue flight, carrying about 180 citizens and
permanent residents on board from Japan, has landed in Australia.

Qantas flight 6032 touched down in Darwin at 8.1lam local time, after
being slightly delayed from takeoff our ofHaneda.

The last-minute drama hit the rescue mission when 10 Australians, who were set to leave the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess ship and head to the airport, were told they had tested positive to coronavirus and had to stay behind.

About 180 citizens and permanent residents, who have spent the past fortnight on the quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan, had taken up the Federal Government's offer of a seat on the repatriation flight to Austra lia.

They join another 36 Australians who contracted coronavirus on the Diamond Princess and are being treated in Japan. About 15 of their relatives declined the offer of repatriation to stay with them.

The Australians on board will be screened for coronavirus five times
before they are taken to a quarantine facility at Howard

Qantas boss Alan Joyce praised the crew who took part in the repatriation flight as well as two previou s Qantas chartered flights that brought Austra l ians home from virus epicentre Wuhan .

"It took literally thousands of hours to plan complex operations like these," Mr Joyce said at t press conference today.

"The crew were all volunteers and they did us proud ."

Yesterday, Australians who were cleared to finally disembark the Diamond Princess were driven by bus to Haneda Airport for the chartered flight home .

They first needed to pass a health check to receive an approval of
disembarkation notice by Japanese quarantine officials.

They were then screened several more times before they could board the Qantas 747.

On the plane, they had no contact with Qantas crew, who remained upstairs for the flight. Food for passengers was already waiting for them at their seats when they boarded.

If they passed the latest health check, they wou ld have been given "approval of disembarkation" notices by Japanese quarantine officials, which grant them permission to enter Japan.

From Yokohama Port, where the ship was docked, they boarded buses to Haneda Airport.

Brisbane student Tehya Pfeffer, 18, who has been quarantined on the
Diamond Princess with her grandmother Cathy, was among them.

"At 10.30am (local time, 12.30pm AEDT) we will start to be screened and given lu ggage tags and wrist bands," Ms Pfeffer told news.com.au yesterday.

"At 5pm we have to have our luggage put outside, and at 6pm we will disembark the ship and go through a makesh ift customs . This is where we use our wrist bands .

"And then we will take a bus to the airport and at around 12am
Thursday we will fly to Darwin."

On the evacuation flight, cabin crew wou ld not be making direct contact with evacuees.

Meals were already waiting for passengers at their seats when they boarded, and Qantas staff remained upstairs.

All those returning to Australia on the Qantas flight will spend two weeks in quarantine at the Howard Springs facility, in addition to the two weeks in lockdown they've had on the ship.

Was listening to the discussion today. There was a discussion about the shortages of PPE. There was also discussion re NPis, but I'm not sure that most folks appreciate that the NPis that have been arrayed as part
of the TLC strategy to reduce disease transmission in the community

can be leveraged to create safer compartments or spaces by shunting disease toward the home.  By implementing these interventions, one could reduce the likelihood of disease in workplaces (by home isolation and home quarantine-- keeping sick employees at home and keeping employees who are well but potentially  infected because someone is sick in their household, at home).  Adding in other social distancing measures including social distancing at work, helps to reduce community transmission (adds additional protection to the workplace). The consequence is shunting disease to the home--120 M different compartments in the US, and making the workplace the safe place.
That is potentially   very important for critical infrastructure .  The answer is not PPE for these employees.  And why would we expect that employees in these sectors would have any better IPC with the use of PPE than we saw with staff on the Diamond Princess?




Healthcare is a key critical infrastructure.  It is different from the other sectors in that it will be attracting patients with COVID  like a magnet. It is hard to imagine how one could makes healthcare  a safe  workplace.  But it is only hard to imagine how one could do that unless you begin to look a little closer at the different components of the healthcare system and the roles each component might play during this pandemic .




To illustrate this, I took a stab at developing a conops or roadmap to look at the various pieces of the healthcare system.  The shunting of disease is really fractal.  Just as we can look at shunting disease across a community into one compartment (the home) to make other
compartments safer, we can do the same within our healthcare system­
shunt disease to the acute care area where COVID patients will be
concentrated. What are the strategies to do that?




This conops is notional.  It is purposely designed for a severe outbreak with severe disease and assumes that the healthcare system must somehow continue to limp along and continue to care for the background  disease we see during no1mal times (strokes, AMls, fractures and trauma , appendicitis, other serious infections, CHF, diabetic emergencies, psychotic episodes, preeclampsia, complicated deliveries, end stage renal disease and dialysis, etc.) as well as sustain outpatients with chronic conditions that require monitoring and care to keep them well and out of the ER and out of the hospital.

Global Affairs says the departure date for a plane that will carry Canadians home from a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan is yet to be confirmed. Spokeswoman Barbara Harvey says the departure wil l be settled once final arrangements are made with the Japanese government and the cruise ship company. A news release from the company operating the Diamond Princess cruise ship says the Canadian flight has been "shifted'' to early Friday morning.

I saw a news sto1y  yesterday (WashPost) that testing was completed. So we should know in the next coupe of days.

Also saw a story about the l00 or so Americans left behind (44 in
hospitals and 61 who declined evacuation).

Hard to find data on the statu s of those still hospitalized in Japan.




James made a very important point yesterday. Although the passengers are elderly (2,666 passengers) , the crew members are relatively young (1,045 crew members).  James also expected the attack rates to be very high among the crew members (they were housed together in a
relatively small space aboard the ship, perfect condjtions for explosive disease transmission). So this combined data on passengers (elderly) and crew (young and healthy) will be invaluable in terms of helping understand severity. I would think that Japan also real izes how invaluable this data is. Japan will be in the best position to assess the impact on the crew, since they will know the results oflab screening and hospitalization of all + crew members (as well as the monitoring quarantine of the rest of the crew over the next 14 days). Bu t now that the passengers are being dispersed, it will be important for several nations to share the data on these passengers-it  is really our best chance to understand severity (would need collaboration of the US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan).

I understand from contacts at WHO that Japan is testing everyone on the Diamond Princess, so we should have a complete accounting of that closed population (and thus a nice dataset to inform severity estimates).

Just talked to a lab director in Hong Kong U. They tested 3,600 passengers and crews on World Dream in 24 hours, all using the definitive RT-PCR test. The tests were performed in government labs. They
disembarked everyone after 3 days (all came back negative). And they are
still performing contact tracing and monitoring on all at the moment.

For surveillance , regional hospitals do an initial screening,then suspected cases are tested by a governmental lab for confirmation.




Schools are still closed for another month.

Japan inching toward mitigation


Abe urges people with cold­ like symptoms to avoid work, school

Today 06:30 am JST 24 Comments

TOKYO

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday advised people across the country not to go to work or school if they develop cold-like symptoms, as the country grapples with the spread of a new coronavirus originating in China.

Workplaces in the country, known for their long hours, need to encourage people to take days off without hesitation if they do not feel well, Abe said.

"The first thing that I want the people of Japan to keep in mind is to take time off school or work and refrain from leaving the house if they develop cold-like symptoms such as fever," Abe told a meeting of a government task force on the viral outbreak.

Teleworking is an "effective alternative" to help prevent the virus from spreading further, Abe said.

He made the remarks as the government is scrambling to contain the virus that originated inWuhan, with more people with no obvious link to China getting infected in Japan.

The global outbreak of the disease called COVID-19 has prompted some event organizers in Japan to rethink their plans for hosting mass gatherings .

The number of confirmed cases in Japan has topped 600, including over 500 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess, a quarantined cruise ship docked at Yokohama near Tokyo with more than 3,000 confined.

The steady rise in infection s in various parts of Japan has raised public concern, prompting the health ministry to ask people who develop symptoms such as a temperature of
37.5 C or higher for at least four days to consult local health care centers and go to designated hospitals . The period is set shorter for the elderly, those with underlying conditions and pregnant women.

As Tokyo and other major cities in the country are notorious for packed rush-hour trains, commuters have
been encouraged by a government panel of medical experts
to go to work earlier or later than usual as the risk of
infection is increased in crowds.

On Tuesday , Fttjitsu Ltd and Hitachi Ltd said they are
expa nding teleworking, though Japanese companies overall have been slow to introduce it.

Hello all - Clearly, the most important thing of all is a reliable , real-time diagnostic test that can differentiate between flu and COVID-19. CDCs test kits were recalled because states said they were not working. Now they have to remanufacture the faulty reagent. How long will that take? If and when more kits are available, will they be available in sufficient quantity that all health care providers will have access?

In all of this, I have not heard anyone talk about the Nanopore MinION technology that has been used for Ebola. What gives??? It is field deployable and can be run in-house. Hospital labs can run thousands of samples at once.  It gives results of all viruses , bacteria, protozoa, fungi, in 2 hours. We all know this technology is quite promising. Why aren't we going gangbusters to validate this rapid technology and get it to all diagnosticians? If ever there was a time to invest in a diagnostic technology, this is it!

Carter,




Just listened in to our state COVID-19 response effort update. Georgia has no COVID-19 cases yet, and hence they remain in the containment period where they place medium-risk individuals on supervised monitoring of home quarantine, advise them to take temperature daily and report any respiratory symptoms (24/7). Educate them not to show up in ED, or any place without facilitation. To
avoid potential disease spread, they are advised to remain at
home.




The next stage will be mitigation when a confirmed case is reported. That ·will initiate the pandemic planning and community-based NPI will be considered.  This includes social distancing  -- telework , teleclass,  etc.




I assume at cities where there are confirmed local COVID- 19 cases, the public health leaders have already begun the mitigation phase now and hence are practicing some degree of social distancing and rolling out telework, and various strategies to protect health in the population and to
maintain business continuity already.  Is that true or they
are still waiting to execute their operations?




There are not many tests needed here in Georgia. But rapid robust and reliable testing kits (Tracey's reporting of cunent bottleneck) remain critical in all communities with positive cases.  If we have such mean s, testing can a l so be conducted (sampling) on some flu-like cases at strategic selected cities also.

>WIOte:




Duane,. Yes. (asymptomatic or mild symptoms)
this is the worry at the very start, and it
remains the most critical. Hence even  1% of infection for us -- can balloon out of proportion and we can't handle. Shedding not only during infection period, but also post-recovery . It's a very long timeline that we have to deal with. Then you have all the university siudents. Students travelled to China and came back to school, they asked health service if they
needed to quarantine or take any action, theadvice -- no need. Those are missed opportunities.	Again, seasonal influenza affects 8-10% Americans, 0.7% of those infected required hospitalization, and morality is roughly 0.1%. So it is easy to "calculate" all these numbers backwards ... So 20% ofCOVID- 19 infected may need hospitalization , mortality is 10-30 times higher than seasonal flu. How much can we tolerate before anyone would spring into action? Keep inmind, some begin to infect rapidly upon contracting the virus, the incubation is so short (and so long) and infectious too during tha1 period (with much being unknown).




Carter, I think you will expect heterogeneous approaches from different communities in the overall response strategy.since it depends on the social setting and the demographics and more importantly the local resources. We have to optimize for sure.

My thinking is evolving in terms of healthcare system response. Initially I described how I would refocus the outpatient clinics away from COVID care and leverage
the NPis of isolation and quarantine to help keep the workplace safe (for the clinic staff and other patients) rather than a strategy that employs PPE.  I would only use the outpatient clinic staff to help with telephone/home care support of those patients under home
isolation or home quarantine--to
help with compliance/adherence to isolation and quarantine, monitoring their health, and optimizing the care of their other chronic medical conditions (to keep them out of the ER and the hospital) . But as I thought more about this, it occurs to me that this can be generalized beyond outpatient clinics.




I would think about dividing our healthcare system into two big pieces :(1) acute care (EDs, acute inpatient care, critical care); and
(2) non-acute care including
outpatient clinics (PC/Family Practice, pediatrics,  OB/GYN, medical specialty, surgical specialty, dental, mental health, rehab, etc.), as well as other inpatient areas (inpatient mental health, substance abuse, nursing homes, hospice care, memory care, assisted living, etc.).
Inpatient surgery (and I suppose labor and delivery) is part of acute care, but for this outbreak, it probably best belongs bundled with the other non-acute inpatient

areas. I would anticipate that the tripwire  for  implementing  NPis (community   transmission),  will also be the trigger  for healthcare systems to dial down or rum off elective admissions (primarily surgical) to free up acute care and ICU/moni tored meds. The most effective  way to protect  these non­ acute  areas is by  shunting
potential  COVID  patients  away from these areas and either providing this type of care while the patients is hospitalized in acute care  or thru  telephone  care/home care for patients with mild illness receiving  care at home. And the most effective way to shunt these patients away from non-acute care areas is thru the implementation of early and aggressive NPis of isolation of the ill and home
quarantine of household contacts (and not fit testing the world and passing out PPE that we don't have).

More puzzle pieces re the cruise
ship outbreak.

 About 2/3rds of the passengers

have been tested so far (2,404 out
of 3,711).

	61
Americans opted to remam onboard and not be evacuated.

Japan has completed tests for all passengers and crew aboard the ship as of Monday , but the results for the last batch of tests aren't expected until
Wednesday, the day that the quarantine is slated to end. So far, results are back for 2,404 passengers and crew, out of the 3,711 who were  on board the ship when the quarantine began on Feb. 5.

Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that people who have tested negative for the virus wou ld start leaving
on Wednesday, but that the
process of releasing passengers and crew won't be finished unti l Friday, according to the Washington Post.

The remaining 61 American passengers on the DP who opted not to join the evacuation will not be allowed to return to the US until March 4, according to the American embassy in Tokyo. The governments of Australia, Hong Kong and Canada have also said they would evacuate passengers .

Elsewhere, Japan confirmed three more cases of the vims. This time, they were confirmed in Wakayama, a prefecture  in eastern Japan .

WHO estimates 80% of patient with COVID-19 have mild disease and recover; that implies that 20% have severe disease. WHO estimated that 14% develop pneumonia and 5% are considered critical. [We were estimating that 12% of cases needed hospitalization (so 88% did not) and 2% needed ICU care (with mortality of patients with pneumonia in the ICU generally between 15%-50% so a CFR of 0,3%-1.0%). Also noet his comment on sparing children. The latter comments are reminiscent of the early comments of public health leaders during the 1918 pandemic-always minimizing.   I have no idea where an attack rate of 4 per 100,000 comes from.]

GENEYA: The new novel coronavirus only causes mild disease for 80 per cent of infected patients, said the World Health Organization on Monday (Feb 17). Speaking to reporters, WHO chiefTedros  Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that 14 per cent of patients would have severe diseases such as pneumonia.

"Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible mu lti-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death," he added.

Tedros also said there were "relatively few cases" among children and more research was needed to understand why.

The WHO chief also warned against "blanket measures" over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a "tiny" proportion of the population.

Ryan said that even at the
epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the "attack rate" - a measme of the speed of spread of the virus - was four per 100,000.

"This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected . Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very
tiny, tiny proportion of people," he said.

Tedros also referred to an apparent decl ine in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend "must be interpreted very cautiously".

88 more people test positive for COVID-19 on Diamond Princess cruise ship.

The new cases take the total number of confirmed cases on the Diamond Princess to 542 - the biggest cluster outside the epicentre in China. [Almost 15% of the crew and passengers have been infected.]




Japan has also confirmed at least 65 cases domestically, including many involving people with no history of recent travel to China. Authorities have said the virus is being transmitted locally now, and have asked citizens to avoid crowds and non-essential gatherings. On Monday, the amateur portion of the Tokyo Marathon, which had been expected to attract some 38,000 runners, was cancelled. Only elite athletes will now be able to take part. The public celebration for Emperor Naruhito's birthday has

also been scrapped over virus fears.




South Korea will send a presidential aircraft on Tuesday to fly back four nationals and one Japanese spouse, an official told reporters. There are 14 South Koreans on board in total, but the other ten have declined to be evacuated from the ship becau se they live in Japan, the Yonhap news agency reported.

More things to keep an eye on (attached links of stories and translations of news reports):




Yesterday a 5th flight of evacuees from Hubei affived in Japan. There were 65 on board and 7 people were symptomatic (11%). Watch for the number of confirmed-it will provide a point estimate of prevalence of COVID- 19 in Hubei as of yesterday.
Sounds like this is the last flight
japan will accept.




Yesterday, Japan provided an update of all cases in Japan:

 53 people were infected in Japan and travelers from China

	454
passengers
and crew members on cruise  ships, and

 13 people
returned on

charter aircraft.

 520 people
in total.

 23 people were determined to be
seriously ill




Watching for other countries to evacuate passengers from cruise ship

	256
Canadians
on the Diamond Princess cruise ship

 32 tested + (as of Feb- 17)

 A plane chartered by the
Canad ian government has left for Japan to evacuate its nationals aboard a virus-hit
cruise ship off Yokohama, TV Asahi reported on Tuesday, citing a

tweet by Canada's foreign minister




Can't find anything about other countri es evacuating passengers (UK, Hong Kong, Italy, etc.)




Last thing.  Am seeing stories from Japan re patients going from clinic to clinic with resp symptoms and fever and being confinned . They are finding nosocomial  transmissi on-so underscores  the concerns outlined in the proposal I outlined for re­ aligning outpatient clinics.

I really need help thinking tbru the
testing piece (screening for
COVID-19). How do we protect the staff in outpatient clinics (where all the ILI is typically seen) and conserve PPE by shifting all the mild illness away from clinics and toward patients ' homes using telephone care/telehealth and home healthcare and employing home

isolation for those who are infected and voluntary home quarantine for otherwise well (but exposed and potentially infected) household contacts?  Having all the suspected patients coming in to clinics to be screened really defeats the purpose.  So how would very large numbers of outpatients get screened? Home screening?  Drive thru screening? Or creating a free standing screening facility for rapid screening? Has anyone thought this thru (how you screen for disease plus promote adherence/compliance to  home
isolation and home quarantine and
shift outpat ient care of patients with mild disease to telephone/home care to protect outpatient clinic staff? Looking for practical solutions.




Just to remind you , here are the estimates of demand (assuming we would need to screen all ILI)­ about 88K per day in primary care clinics across the US.

More details on evacuation of American passengers aboard the cruise ship.

Total evacuated:  177+151=328




httos://www.usa  today.com/story/tr avel/cru ises/2020/ 02/ 1 7/ corona vi r us-diamond-princess-evacuees­ test-pos  itive-allowed-fly-united­ states/4783787002/




Fourteen evacuees from the
Diamond Princess cruise
ship quarantined  in Japan  were allowed to fly back to the United States  Sunday  despite  testing positive for coronavirus, the U.S. State Department and Health and Human Services said in a joint statement. The evacuees were not symptomatic.

"These individuals were moved in the most expeditious  and safe manner to a specialized
containment area on the
evacuation aircraft to isolate them in  accordance  with  standard protocols," the
statement, published Sunday,
read .

The State Department was unaware the individuals had coronavirus when they were being removed from the ship; they had tested negative just a few days before, Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for
preparedness  and response at the
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, said on a phone call with repo1ters.

"If those results had come back four hours earlier before we'd started to disembark the ship and before these people were evacuees within an evacuation system, then it would've been a different discussion." Dr. William Walters, director of operational medicine at the U.S . Department of State, said on the call.

Kadlec said that individuals received multiple screenings when moving from ship to bus to
plane and a more extensive medical assessment upon arrival.

Two charter flights carrying
the Diamond Princess passengers landed at military bases in California and Texas overnight, starting the clock on a 14-day quarantine period to ensure those passengers don't have
corona vir us. In total, approximately 380 Americans were on board the Diamond Princess ship for the duration of the cruise and quarantine at sea.

'Something went awry': Why did US break Diamond Princess coronavirus quarantine?

One plane carrying American passengers touched down at Travis Air Force Base in northern California just before  11:30 p.m. Sunday local time. A second flight arrived at Lackland Air Force
Base in Texas arou nd 2Yz hou rs later, early Monday.

The California flight had 177
people on it, seven of whom tested positive for coronavirus, Wa lters said. An additional three people were isolated during the flight for fever. Upon arrival, 171 stayed  in Travis while six trave led to Omaha.

It's unclear which passengers were transferred there and whether initial tests were positive or whether they were at risk for the
VlfUS.

The Texas flight had 151 people board and included the other seven who tested positive for coronavirus. Two additional passengers were isolated on account of fever. All passengers who tested positive for
coronavirus then moved on to
Omaha.

The aircraft design allowed passengers to sit in isolation thanks to a plastic divider at the tail of the aircraft.


13 high-risk passengers await test resuIts at Nebraska Medical Center

Officials from the University of Nebraska Medical Center and Nebraska Medicine confirmed that they are assessing 13 adults at
their quarantine and biocontainment facility in Omaha.

"Late last night at about 2 or 3 a.m., we were asked to bring some individuals here who had either tested positive or had a high likelihood of testing positive because of symptoms they were exhibiting," said Dr. Chris Kratochvil, the executive director at the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Global Center for Health Security.

Twelve of them are housed in the quarantine center while one man was transferred to the hospital's biocontainment unit for testing and observation because of symptoms including cough, fever, shortness of breath, lightheadedness  and an
undisclosed chronic condition that would make him particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19
V1fUS.

"He is doing good and in stable condition at this time," reported Shelly Schwedhelm, Nebraska Medicine's executive director of emergency management and biopreparedness.

She went on to note that "the folks in the quarantine center have all been tested, and we're waiting for those  results ."

She added that the other 12 are isolated in "very nice rooms with WiFi, TV and a small refrigerator

- a lot of the amenities at hotels but with engineering controls" to prevent contaminated air from escapmg.

Their test results, which are due back Monday afternoon, will determine whether the patients will be allowed to see their spouses or leave their rooms.

Regardless of whether they test positive or negative, all of the new arrivals will spend at least 14 days in the facility, and any who test positive will likely stay longer, said Dr. Mike Wadman, the co­ medical director of the Nationa l Quarantine Unit.

Kratochvil  says it's possible that they may be asked to take more patients should more of the Diamond Princess passengers now in quarantine at the airbases test positive.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the Nat ional Institutes of Health, told the USA TODAY editorial board and reporters Monday that the original idea to keep people safely
qu arantined on the ship wasn't unreasonable. But even with the quarantine process on the ship, virus transmission still occu rred.

"The q u arantine process failed ," Fauci said. "I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed. People were getting infected on that ship. Something went awry in the process of the quarantining on that ship. I don't

know what it was, but a lot of people got infected on that ship."

USA TODAY reached ou t to Princess Cruises for clarification on how many Americans from the ship have the virus.

A correction. Should not have included breakdown of hospitalized since we have spotty data 9or could have used a range). Only solid data we have is number

conf1.11ned   (58), number in  hospital   (44),  and  number   in ICU (.'.'.:1).   Mix of hospital patients  is unknown   (from  the   Singapore   data the  ratio  of hospitalized   to  ICU
has ranged from 6:1to13:1 from
two data points).




So estitnates of severity looking
only at the American passengers :

-400 total American passengers 58 confirmed to have COVID-19


(20%)

12 Asymptomatic


        46 Symptomatic (80%) (44 cases actually hospitalized)

               -2% of total cases requirin g ICU admission (1 case)

Expected mortality for patients with pneumonia admitted to ICU (15-50%);
assuming 2% of those who become infected with COVID-19 require ICU care, these mortality rates equate to a CFR of 0.3%-1.0%

Trying to estimate severity by bringing a number of pieces together.




The Diamond Princess Cruise Ship had a crew of 1,745 and 2,666 passengers  (total pf3,71 l) Approximately 400 of the passengers are Americans  (11%). Several days ago (Feb-13) we
attempted to estimate disease
severity using the current data
being reported by the media (number of confomed cases and ICU cases) as well as data on the outbreak in Singapore (number of confitmed  cases, number hospitalized , and number in ICU) (see attached Word file).




Given the  add itional  information becoming   available  (including more specific information being reported by the media on the
numbers of Americans infected), I
was interested in an updated cmde estimate of severity (and to see how well the early predictions  of severity matched with what was being reported by the media on
illness in the Americans.  See

latest re the cruise ship outbreak below (two stories). We can glean from these stories that the number infected is now up to 454. And 14 positive passengers were included among the Americans who were evacuated to the US. Canada, South Korea, Italy and Hong Kong announced Sunday that they
would also arrange charter flights
to evacuate their citizens. A few additional pieces of data. News reports yesterday stated that 73 of the 355 confirmed cases from the cruise ship were asymptomatic (20%). Also, yesterday the media quoted Dr. Fauci that the total number of Americans who were confirmed to have COVID yesterday and who remained at hospitals in Japan at 44.
Assuming that this number does not include the  14 confirmed cases that were evacuated, suggests that the total number of Americans
with confirmed COVID is 58. An earlier news report from Feb-12 re a couple from California , noted
the husband was in the ICU in Japan (so at least 1 American in the ICU).	["...remained  in a hospital intensive care unit and has been able to communicate with his family, his wife said in a phone interview from the ship, where she remained in quarantine."

with-a-high-fever-tested-for­
coronav irus/ ]




So, piecing all the data together:




The -400 Americans account for 11% of the 3,711 passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess.

The 58 confirmed cases among Americans account for 12% of the 454 tota l confirmed COVID cases

Assuming that proportion of asymptomatic cases in Americans is similar to the proportion of asymptomatic cases for the entire ship (73/355 or 20%), we would estimate the number of Americans with asymptomatic infection at
-12. Symptomatics  would  be 46. If2% of cases result in ICU admission (based on earlier estimates on Feb-12 where 4 ICU cases were reported with 203 total confirmed cases), we would expect-9 ICU cases overall with 454 infected. Media repo1ts from today note 19 of the passengers are "seriously ill, with some of whom treated in intensive care units." (Would be helpful to
quantify "some"-from the earlier
data, we would estimate about half that number would require ICU care at some point). For the 54 Americans confirmed to have COVID, we would estimate 1 would require ICU care if 2% of cases required ICU care (we are already aware of at least 1 American who was receiving ICU care in Japan) .



So estimates of severity looking
only at the American passengers:

-400 total American passengers

58 confirmed to have COVID-19




(20%)

12 Asymptomatic


46 Symptomatic (80%)

                -55% of total cases mildly ill (hospitalized for isolation only) (31 cases)

                -25% of total cases acutely ill requiring inpatient care  (15 cases)




of total cases requiring ICU
admission (1 cases)

-2%


Exp ecte d mort ality for patie nts with pneu mon

thes
e
mor talit y rates equa te to a CFR
of
0.3
%-
1.0
%




Those estimates fit pretty well with the estimates from Feb-13. To firm up these numbers it would be useful to have actual numbers from Japan on ICU admissions, number requiring mechanical ventilation, number in the hospital because they are acutely ill, and number in the hospital because of isolation only (mildly ill or asymptomatic). Also would be helpful to have more granula r

infom1ation on the Americans (hospital data in Japan including number acutely ill, number needing ICU admission, and number only in the hospital for isolation). Would also be critical to gather/compile the same information from Canada, South Korea, Italy, Hong Kong, and
other nations as they also evacuate their citizens.  The cruise ship is a circumscribed population where it is possible to get a handle on severity fairly early in an
epidemic.  The limitation though, is the population on board that ship is elderly (so need to be careful about generalizing to the entire population) .  But it is the best data we have.




The reason why this is so important is decisions re the implementation of NPis depend upon severity (the more severe the more intense the NPis).  The sooner we have a more accurate assessment of severity, the better for making plans for NPls.

New virus cruise ship confirmed
99 new infections

February  17, 2020 18:54

A new outbreak of the coronavirus was confirmed on February  17, with 99 new passengers and crew members infected on a cruise ship. As a result, 454 passengers and crew members of cruise ships
have been infected, of which 19 are severely affected.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, a total of 99 new passengers, including 85 passengers and 14 crewmembers, were revealed on March 17 on the cruise ship "Diamond Princess" anchored in Yokohama Port. Among them, there are 43 Japanese.

This means that a total of 1723 passengers and crew members were inspected on the cruise ship, and a total of 454 infection s were confirmed.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 19 of the confirmed individuals are seriously ill, some of whom are being treated in intensive care units.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said that infections were confirmed one after another on

cruise ships. Need to be analyzed quickly. "

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has a policy to conduct a virus test on all passengers and crew members remaining on board, and those who have a negative result will be asked to leave the ship after the 19th.









Story #2




Fourteen people who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and flown back to the United States on charter flights tested positive fornovel coronavirus, according  to a joint statement from the US Departments of State and Health and Human Services.

The passengers are among the more than 300 people removed from the ship, which is docked off the Japanese port city of Yokohama , Sunday night and flown to military bases in the
Un ited States.

US officials were notified that they had tested positive for coronavirus during the evacuation process, after passengers  had
disembarked the ship, the agencies
said in the joint  statement Monday. The passengers had been tested two to three days before the

evacuation flights, the statement said.

"After consultation with HHS officials, including experts from the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the State Department made the decision to allow the 14 individuals, who were in isolation, separated from other passengers, and continued to be asymptomatic, to remain on the aircraft to complete the evacuation process," the agencies said.

One charter flight carrying evacuated Americans arrived at Travis Air Force Base near Fairfield, California, around  11:28
p.m. local time Sunday. A second anived at Joint Base San Antonio­ Lackland in San Antonio, Texas at 3:56 a.m. local time Monday.

The passengers who tested positive were isolated from the other passengers during the
flights, the statement said. And all passengers are being "closely monitored" throughout the flight.

"Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said.

After the flights land, any passengers that developed symptoms on the flights and those who had already tested positive will be transported to "an appropriate location for continued isolation and care."

The remaining passengers will remain under quarantine for 14 days.

Passengers arriving to Travis Air Force Base will be housed in the same facility as evacuees who arrived from Wuhan earlier this month, a spokesperson for the
base told CNN. New evacuees will be kept in a separate area of the Westwind Inn on the base, the spokesperson  said.

Before the announcement about the infected flight passengers, some Americans aboard the Diamond Princess said they didn't want to take a chance being evacuated for fear they would be subject to possible infection.

Sacramento resident Matthew Smith told CNN affiliate KOVR that he would rather deal with issues in Japan than be evacuated and quarantined in the United States.

"We decided we would just face whatever consequences here rather than exposing ourselves to that situation," Smith told the
affiliate ."It kind of didn't make
any sense if the us was fearful that these were infected people which is why they're going to quarantine them for another 2 weeks to have thrown them all together"

Smith's wife Katherine Codekas was met with some surprise when she told authorities that she and her husband weren't going to go
with the other American evacuees,
KOVR reported.

"They came back around again and I said no we're not going and they very sincerely wished us luck but there was a little look of surprise on their face," Codekas explained to the affiliate.

"You know, it's not like we're the last helicopter off th e roof top in Ho Chi Mihn City," she told KOVR. "We're on a boat and we're watching people go away and people just make different choices about how they want to confront the virus."

This is the original graph of Bob Glass' data. He modeled the various interventions alone or in combination. Along one axis are the social distancing measures from doing nothing, to just  closing schools but allowing kids to mix
in the community, to social distancing of kids in the community but keeping schools open, to only social distancing of adults in the community, to closing schools and adults social distancing, to kids and adults social distancing in the
community, to closing schools and social distancing of kids in the community , to a combo of all 3. Along the other axis are other interventions  incJuding doing nothing,  to quara ntine (Q), treatment  of the illw ith antivirals (T), prophylaxis of contacts (P), and various combinations.  We observed what we called a "cliff effect" or phase transit ion or a discontinuity  once you closed schools and implemented social distancing among kids.  The effect was non-linear and dramatic.  As a consequence we began a deep dive to better understand the school environment  (includ ing  the

transportation system half the school age kids u se each day) and school age kids.  An unsung hero in all this was Lisa Koonin (who was at CDC at the time).  If Richard birthed TLC, Lisa kept the baby alive in the neonatal ICU.




We still have much to learn about this virus. Thus far, it seems to be sparing kids Gust like SARS). We have been monitoring the reports from China as well as the detailed data we can see from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan-the numbers of kids remain very low and disease appears to be mild. Nonet heless, TLC (and the NPis) is focused on reducing disease transmission  (effectively decreasing Ro)-the interventions are really agnostic to severity. It is why CDC had to scale the implementation of TLC (later called CMG) to severity. Despite the absence of severe disease in kids, we really are still in the dark in tenns of the amount of
asymptomatic disease or mild sub­ clinical disease in kids because we just haven't been able to look.




I never forgot this graph of the data from Bob Glass and the inflection point that was observed when the combo of closing schools and social distancing of kids was implemented in his model.  Although closing schools
is complicated by its 2nd and 3rd order impacts , it is actually a pretty clean intervention in terms

of actually pulling the trigger (much cleaner than the other componen ts of TLC).   If this outbreak proves to be as severe as our initial estimates, we should think long and hard before dismissing the  early implementation  of this strategy (closing schools and social distancing of kids).

NPis are going to be central to our response to this outbreak (assuming  our estimates  of severity  prove accurate).    This email group has grown   since we began (not quite epidemic-level growth, but getting there). Looking ahead, Ianticipate we might encounter pushback over  the  implementation   ofNPis  and would  expect  similar
concerns/arguments  as were  raised back in 2006 when thls strategy first emerged. It was one of the reasons 1 shared the updated data on US households  from Amer ican Community  Survey, data  on USDA  programs  for nutritional support (including school meal programs), data on schools and enrollment, and even data on juvenile crime. The data that was gathered back  in 2006  on social density  in  various  environments

(homes,  offices/workplaces, schools, daycare, etc., is unchanged) . For additional background and context, we attached are 3 papers on NPis and TLC for those who are interested. Richard Hatchett deserves full credit for birthing the idea of TLC (it was actually developed in response to the threat of H5N 1 and later adopted for pandemic influenza response). Duane, perhaps you can store these documents on MAX for safe keeping and access?

The first paper is an historical review of the 1918 pandemic (the comparison of Philadelphia and St. Louis is emblematic of the lesson from 1918 that timing matters  when  deploying NPis­ need to be early). The second paper is modeling work that was done to evaluate these strategies. At the time, modelers were focused on how best to contain an
outbreak overseas (really focusing on using antivirals primarily for treatment and prophylaxis).  They focused their models to evaluate the effectiveness of various strategies and quantities of antiviral medications required to quench an emerging outbreak. There were 3 groups who were doing this work back then. They each present their data in that paper. A few things to note. In all the model runs, they did not model
perfection or 100% adherence
(actually far from it).  You will see scenarios from 30/60 (meaning 30% compliance and 60% ascertainment) on up to 90/80 ). (See figures 1) Even leaky implementation can reduce overall

attack rates. The modelers also looked at timing of
implementation (see figure 3). At the time there was a great deal of skepticism-was hard for people to believe this was possible . Or even if TLC could be effective, was implementation practical given the challenges trying to
implement and the 2nd and 3rd order consequences (especially of closing schools).  But the modeling data combined with the historical data was the tipping point. Marty Cetron from CDC
and Howard Markel from U of
Michigan, published a more extensive historical review of the 1918 pandemic showing much the same. Since then, a group within CDC continued to work on this (collecting additional data from the 2009 pandemic and elsewhere). They published an update of CMG in MMWR in 2017.

pandem ic-flu.htm l




The third paper, is a more recent paper (from 2017) that Richard shared with me. The paper is a little dense, but

I found this paper useful because it
provides a vocabu lary for strategies that we have raised (Symptom Monitoring vs

Quarantine of potentially infected but symptom-free contacts during an epidemic). This paper identifies those conditions where SM or Q is preferred. Figure 1is useful for understanding the challenges given the picture that seems to be emerging with this virus. This outbreak seems closer to pandemic flu than SARS in terms of transmission dynamics (and hence the NPis we would need to employ).

Lastly, another person, Bob Glass at Los Alamos, also did work on this separately from the MIDAS group. He actually began this work as pa1t of a science fair project for his daughter (using
social contacts of his daughter and
her classmates at school to model disease transmission). He knew someone at VA who forwarded his work to us (chain of
transmission).   Early on (even before the MIDAS group modeled TLC), we had a "Eureka" moment when we graphed his data in Excel (I can share that single graph to anyone interested). Bob Glass was also interested in trying to determine when you could let up on the NPis during a pandemic. Here is a story about Bob Glass and that work published in Fast Company

letting up on NPis could be critical down the line.

Hi Carter, great points.




l. Separate current ED/ICU patients from COVID-19 is a must.

2. Migrating current ED/ICU (non-COVID) patients to other care sites is great idea.




3. Caring for COVID-19
patients :leveraging ED/ICU personnel for high compliance and usage of limited resources (PPE everything that goes with it) is very critical. Strategic usage and minimizing non-medical staff is
necessary --- either these operators
are well-trained and protected, or
they cannot be there.




4. Concentrating care within ED/ICU for COVID-19 ensures rapid learning and sharing of knowledge among workers as they take care of these patients.
Clearly from the standpoint of data collection and clinical symptoms recording and organization, it is more feasible and allow for immediate analysis and feedback.




5. Strategic prioritization of limited resources is extremely important. We must do it now, because the supply chain is already being affected and it can go worse.




6. Primary care and call centers are good. Ifyou want to do
strategic testing, this is also a good place to involve.

7. So few children are reported among the confirmed positive cases . They may be good spreaders (not necessarily have to be super) and the more vulnerable people would be ones show up with symptomatic disease characteristics  (or no/mild symptoms).




Best, Eva

Wanted to bounce something off this group.




I have been concerned about some of the preparedness efforts
of hea Ithcare systems

as they are ramping
up their capabilities to care for patients with COVID-19  presenting anywhere in their system.  Staff
working in ERs and ICUs are pretty familiar with the care of these types of patients and the use of appropriate PPE (standard contact and airborne precautions including eye protection).  The staff at the hospitals undergo fit testing for respirators, etc.  Staff in outpatient clinics (especially remote community based outpatient clinics) don't  typically undergo fit testing for respirators.  So ERs and ICUs have
muscle memory for
isolating patients and providing care to patients with infectious respiratory disease.  Community based outpatient clinics do not.




As part of the preparedness efforts, there has been interest in fit testing
outpatient clinic staff and supplying these clinics with PPB and establishing procedures for

evaluating  COVID-19 patients in the community based clinics.  Given the projected shortages of PPE, that just  doesn't seem like the most prudent approach.




Rather than expand the care of potential COVID-19 patients to community based outpatient clinics, I wou ld focus on hospital care--ERs
and inpatient areas (especially ICUs). I would not pursue fit testing for staff working in outlying clinics. As a strategy, I suggested dividing COVID patients  into two    categories-(1) those with illness that is mild enough to be cared for at home (self care or care by other family members); or (2) those who are sick enough to be seen in the ER for possible hospitalization. I would refocus the efforts of outlying clinics away from COVID and toward keeping non-COVID
patients with the usual mix of acute and chronic illnesses we see from hypertension to CHF to diabetes,

etc., out of the ER and out of the hospital. That is what they can do to help unburden ERs and hospitals for the surge in COVID patients in ERs and hospitals.  I would leverage telephone care as much as possible to handle patients with mild disease seeking care related to COVID
(and quickly develop algorithms to determine who has mild disease and can be managed by telephone at home and who needs to evaluated in the ER). Think of it like the program Lisa developed for pandemic influenza (Nurse On Call) on steroids, minus the antiviral piece. Could we repurpose and leverage that program for COVID? Such a
strategy would help to conserve our PPE supply (avoid the expansion of fit testing and the redirection of already limited supplies of PPE to outlying clinics) and not ask outlying clinics to do something they don't typically do (that usually doesn't out
turn out very well). If

the outlying clinics focused on what they normally do (caring for patients with chronic diseases), they could help the
ER and hospitals cope with the demands of COVID. I would
think about Urgent
Care centers in the same way-to help  to decompress ERs.

I also think that we need to strut thinking about strategies to conserve PPE for hospitals.  I'm concerned about the projected burn rates and the supply chains for PPE.  Click on Amazon and check out the prices now.
 Or click on WalMart (can't pick up any masks from WalMart now).  I saw one supplier selling 200 surgical masks on WalMmt's site for only $459.99. Such a deal.




As a conservation strategy, we might think about limiting the amount of staff interacting with infected patients and cohorting patients (even thinking of strategies to minimize need for

housekeeping or food service or lab services from entering areas with COVID patients­
-think Ebola-like strategies (not out of concern of disease transmission  but simply to limit number of staff to conserve PPE). Could do something similar with ERs (akin to what pediatricians do to separate sick call patients from other appointments) .   I have recommend prioritizing PPE for
EDs and ICUs as well as specific inpatient areas where we would likely initially cohort patients, not pursuing fit testing of
outpatient clinic staff, and shifting patients with mild COVID disease to telephone care and away from outpatient clinics.




I know several of you are part of large healthcare systems. Am curious how others are approaching this challenge.




I am also resending the questions I posed

for handling sick ER/hospital staff or staff members with  a confim1ed case of COVID in their household. Carter

Why do I think a pandemic is likely? The infection is in many parts of China and many countries in the world, with meaningful numbers  of secondary transmissions. The scale is much larger than SARS for example (where the US had many introductions and no known onward tran smission)

Why do [think 40-70% infected? Simple math models with oversimple assumptions would predict far more than that given the RO estimates in the 2-3 range (80-90%). Making more realistic assumptions about mixing, perhaps a little help from seasonality, brings the numbers down

pandemic flu in 1968 was estimated to
_symptomatically_ in.feet 40% of the population, and in 1918 30%. Those likely had RO less than COVID-19.

What could make this scenario not happen?  1) conditions in Wuhan could be so different in some fundamental way from elsewhere that we are mistaken in expecting further outbreaks to have basic aspects in common. No reason I know of to
think that but a fom1al possibility



Marc Lipsitch (@mlipsitch)

14/02/2020, 17:53

2) There could be a higher degree of superspreading than has been appreciated  ("dispersion in RO")
which could mean that many locations outside Wuhan could "get lucky" and escape major onward transmission. hopkin sidd .githu b .io/ nCoV­ Sandbox/D... .

3) Control measures could be extremely effective in locations that have had time to prepare. Maybe in a few, but seems unlikely that is the case in all, especially countries with stretched health
systems.

4) Seasonal factors could be much more powerful at reducing transmission than we currently expect. That doesn't help the Southern hemisphere,  and is not  consistent with behavior  in China  (preprint in queue from   D@MauSantillana D   et al.)

I have been following these various iterations closely over the past couple of hours and Iagree with Dan. It looks like we have actually finally arrived at a good place and a point of comfortable agreement between ASPR and CDC.  Am I correct and do we all agree with the latest tracked document (see attached)?

Update on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan


We commend the extraordinary efforts by the Government of Japan to institute quarantine measures onboard the Diamond Princess. While the quarantine potentially conferred a  significant public health benefit in slowing transmission, CDC's assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship.  CDC believes the rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk. Therefore, to protect the health of the American public, all passengers and crew of the ship have been placed under travel restrictions, preventing them from returning to the United States for at least 14 days after they had left the Diamond Princess.

Currently, there are more than 100 U.S. citizens still onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship or in hospitals in Japan. These citizens have been placed under the restrictions, as have the ship's other passengers and crew.


After disembarkation from the Diamond Princess, these passengers and crew will be required to wait 14 days without having symptoms or a positive coronavirus test result before they are permitted to board flights to the United States.


Ifan individual from this cruise arrives in the United States before the 14-day period ends, they will still be subject to a mandatory quarantine until they have completed the 14-day period with no symptoms or positive coronavirus test results.


Because of their high-risk exposure, there may be additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the remaining passengers on board the Diamond Princess.


CDC is committed to protecting the health and safety of all Americans. We continue to believe
that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to the general public in the United States is currently
low.  The U.S. Government is taking these measures to protect the Diamond Princess passengers and crew, their loved ones, the traveling public, and communities within the United States.

Hey Caitlin and Katie,


Happy Friday! I'm working on a story about the coronavirus response, aiming to publish tomorrow. The story is about how President Trump has praised China and President Xi, but that has made some of his advisors uncomfortable given the lack of transparency from China and the inability to get CDC scientists in to the country. We also have some details about the response and the task force, and some disagreements that have arisen. I've listed the points we have in the story that pertain to HHS- would you be able to take a look, I.et me know if there are any issues and potentially provide a comment? I included some quotes from Sec. Azar's interviews on Friday with CNN and CNBC but also happy to include a quote from the agency.

Irealize I'm sending this at the end of the day, so would it be possible for you to get back to me by 1pm
tomorrow? Let me know what works on your end.Thanks so much.


 President Trump has lavished praise on China and its ruler, Xi Jin ping, for its handling of the growing coronavirus outbreak - a posture some in his administration are growing increasingly uncomfortable with as his advisors remain concerned about China's transparency and handling of the epidemic.
 Trump's praise towards Xi has irked some advisors, who say those comments and others about how the virus will likely behave reflect how the president is being briefed,underscor ing tensions within the administration over its handling of the outbreak and the message it should be sending to the American public.
 Worries about the market and tenuous negotiations with China over a trade deal have played a large role in influencing Trump's friendly posture.
 Trump has told advisors he does not want the administration to do or say anything that would further spook the markets, but remains worried that any large-scale outbreak in the U.S. could hurt his reelection bid.
 For weeks, the administration's messaging was that the threat to the American public remained low and the virus was not spreading within communities. But some advisors pushed for a more balanced message because they expect there to eventually be some community spread as the outbreak grows, and the administration has since adjusted its message to reflect that.
 In an effort to keep Trump calm and restrained, Azar has been briefing the president that "everything is under control, totally under control," which has kept Trump from doing or saying anything drastic.
 HHS officials have also told Trump that the number of infections could go down in the spring when it gets warmer, which is mainly an educated guess.
 Some officials have complained that Trump1s comments emanate from his briefings with Azar, who they say has sought to control the response. He has told other doctors,including Anthony Fauci, not to get too far into the details of the virus and outbreak with Trump . Instead, Azar has instructed doctors to let him handle it.
 Azar has also wanted to be the one to announce major updates about the administration's response to the virus. On Thursday, he briefed the Senate Finance Committee that the CDC would use public health labs infive cities that normally test for influenza to also test for
coronavirus,taking state health officials by surprise.
 Some officials said the response has become smoother and better coordinated in recent weeks.

There are new indications that the incubation period for the virus could be longer than the currently believed 14 days, with patients testing positive after much longer quarantine periods. This development came as infections rose in South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy and the head of the World Health Organization warned that the window for stopping the epidemic was narrowing.
Here's what we know:
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been advised that the situation in Wuhan "remains grim and complex."
South Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases Saturday,with the number of cases in South Korea doubling in a day. A fifth person died in Iran from the virus, while Italy now has 50 confirmed cases, making it the largest hot spot in Europe.
China reported only 397 new cases Saturday, as the rate of increase continued to decline, but an additional 109 people have died.There continues to be a great dea l of skepticism about China's numbers as the criteria for diagnosing coronavirus keep changing.
A team of international epidemic experts had Wuhan added to their itinerary in China, following
questions about why they wouldn't go to the center of the coronavirus outbreak that has caused more than 2,000 deaths in the country.
Scientists in China said they had isolated coronavirus strains in urine,raising the possibility that it might be transmissible that way,as well as through feca l matter and respiratory droplets.


BEIJING - Scientists are studying reports that the incubation period for coronavirus could be longer than the currently believed 14 days, potentially casting doubt on current quarantine criteria for
contain ing the virus amid an increasingly urgent effort to stop the epidemic from spreading in northeast Asia and across the world.
South Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases Saturday, while in China, an additional 109 people died and a fifth person died from the virus in Iran. Italian authorities on Saturday said the country was seeing a sudden rise in coronavirus cases, with roughly 50 confirmed in the past two days
- an outbreak that represents the largest yet across Europe.
Meanwhile, scientists in China reported indications that the virus might be transmissible through urine. A team of experts from the World Health Organization was due to arrive Saturday in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday stressed the urgency of containing the
spread of the coronavirus, after cases were reported earlier in Iran and Lebanon.
"Although the window of opportunity is narrowing to contain the outbreak, we still have a chance to contain it," he told reporters in Geneva. "If we don't, if we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious problem on our hands."
Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has not visited Wuhan since the outbreak began, was briefed that the situation in the city and in surrounding Hubei province "remains grim and complex," according to a report by the official Xinhua News Agency published Saturday.
"The nationwide inflection point of the epidemic has not yet arrived," the report said after a meeting of
Communist Party leaders.
China's National Health Commission reported Saturday that 397 new cases of coronavirus had been diagnosed Friday, taking the total to more than 76,000. The rate of infection outside Hubei appears to have slowed markedly, although there has been a great deal of confus ion about the statistics this week as officials have repeatedly changed the criteria for confirming cases.
Among the new cases discovered Friday were a 70-year-old man in Hubei who was confirmed as
infected after 27 days in isolation, while a man in J iangxi province tested positive after 14 days of centralized quarantine and five days of isolation at home. On Thursday, authorities reported that a man in Hubei had tested positive for coronavirus after what appeared to be a 38-day incubation period with no symptoms.
Coronavirus cases in South Korea skyrocket; cases triple in Japan
In Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion reported Saturday that 229 additional cases of the coronavirus had been detected, taking the total to 433, more than doubling in the space of a day. This makes it the worst-affected country outside China.
"Apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, [South] Korea now has the most cases outside China, and we're working closely with the government to fully understand the transmission dynamics that led to this increase," Tedros said.
The majority of the new cases have been traced to existing clusters at a church in southern city of Daegu
and a hospital in nearby Cheongdo County, according to the KCDC.
The South Korean government has designated Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang province as "special care zones" where containment efforts and support will be concentrated.

More than half of South Korea's cases are connected to Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
Since members of the church attended a funeral at nearby Cheongdo Daenam hospital, 111coronavirus cases have been reported there, including two patients who died from the virus.

The mass infection at the hospital is centered on its locked psychiatric ward, where a confined environment could have aggravated transmissions, said Jung Eun-Kyeong, director ofthe KCDC.
A man in his 40s was found dead at his home in city of Gyeongju, east of Daegu, after becoming infected with the virus.He is the third person to die from the virus in South Korea.
Trump was not told coronavirus-infected Americans would be flown home from cruise ship
In Japan, the number of coronavirus cases rose to 121on Saturday, more than tripling in a week .That number excludes the 634 people on board the Diamond Princess who contracted the virus.
One of the latest cases was a teacher in her 60s at a public junior high school east of Tokyo, who complained of nausea while working .The mayor of Chiba city said the school will be closed until Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK reported.
The teacher had not traveled abroad in the past two weeks and has no record of having been in contact with a known infected person, underlining the fact that the virus is now spreading almost invisibly throughout the country, experts say.
Quarant ines in effect in parts of Italy amid sudden spike in cases
As numbers suddenly rose in Italy, the government has scrambled to contain the new outbreak, asking some 50,000 people to stay indoors and suspending all public events - including religious ceremonies and school - in 10 small towns to the south of Milan.
Until a few days ago,Italy had seen only three confirmed infections, including a pair of Chinese tourists . "There is quite an evident contagion, a very strong one," said Giulio Gallera, health chief of the northern Lombardy region, which has seen the majority of the cases.
Italian officials on Friday attributed the country's first death to the coronavirus, and on Saturday said that a 77-year-old woman had also tested positive for the virus after being found dead in her home. But Italian authorities said the woman suffered from other health conditions, and were unsure if it was the virus that had killed her.
As of Saturday afternoon, there were 39 confirmed cases in the prosperous Lombardy region, which includes the country's financial hub, Milan.There were another 12 cases in the neighboring northern region of Veneto.
The regional president of Veneto, Luca Zaia, said it is becoming harder to figure out how the virus is jumping from one place to the next.
"It goes to show you that having other cases of contagion is absolutely possible," Zaia said.
According to Italian media reports, one of the first people to come down with the virus was a 38-year­ old who'd had dinner with somebody who had just come back from China .But some three weeks passed between that dinner and the time the man came down with a fever. In between, he ran a half­  marathon, played soccer and traveled to several towns, according to La Repubblica, a major Italian
daily .
Iran, meanwhile, announced its fifth death from the virus, raising the country's overall total confirmed cases to twenty eight .
Efforts to clear the Diamond Princess cruise ship continue
Meanwhile, tests are continuing on the crew members on board the Diamond Princess. At least 74 crew members have so far been found to have the virus.
All of the passengers have now been tested and almost all have left the ship, either to go home if they tested negative, to local hospitals or government facilities if they have the virus, or back to their home countries.
Some passengers were asked to stay on board to serve an additional quarantine if their cabin mate contracted the virus, but this group is also disembarking Saturday to serve out the rest of their quarantine in a government facility, local media reported.

More than 200 port calls in Japan by international cruise ships have been canceled since the beginning of February due to the coronavirus outbreak, a Kyodo News survey showed Saturday, with the lost revenue from passengers coming ashore dealing another blow to Japan's weak economy .
Controversy continues to simmer about the infection control procedures on board the ship, after a doctor complained on Tuesday about "chaotic" and scary conditions on board.
Six people working on the boat or with the passengers, including four government officials, a medic and an ambulance driver, have contracted the virus.
Media reports questioned why about 90 government officials who worked on the ship have returned to work without being tested for the coronavirus .Asked about this, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government is "trying to confirm what operations staff were involved in specifically."
American woman in Malaysia declared free of coronavirus
The 83-year-old woman who tested positive for the coronavirus when she arrived at Kuala Lumpur airport after disembarking in Cambodia from the MS Westerdam cruise ship has recovered, Malaysia health authorities said Saturday.
The woman "is showing good improvement and signs of recovery, however, she is still being monitored and managed in hospital for a slight cough," Malaysia's director general of health, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said in a statement .
The woman repeatedly tested negative while on board the ship and when she disembarked in Sihanoukville, then twice tested positive while transiting in Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 15.That set off a global scramble to track the hundreds of other passengers who had also disembarked then boarded planes bound for home.
The woman was taken to a hospital and given antiviral treatment and supplementary oxygen,and she showed improvement after 72 hours of treatment initiation, Abdullah said.Two more tests, conducted 24 hours apart,both came back negative for coronavirus.
But the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cast doubt on whether the woman was ever infected, saying she "never had coronavirus to our knowledge."
"I have confirmed that all the passengers were tested, and they have come back negative for coronavirus,including the person who initially tested positive," USA Today quoted CDC spokesperson Richard Quartarone as saying. The woman "may have had a respiratory illness, but if she did, it was not covid-19," he said, using the official name for the virus.
Cambodia's Ministry of Health had previously cleared the 747 crew members who were still on board the Westerdam and the 781 passengers who were still in the country of coronav irus infection. Chinese scientists isolate coronavirus strains in urine as WHO prepares visit Separately, scientists in China are continuing to study how the virus is transmitted .
A research team led by renowned Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan had isolated live coronavirus strains in urine samples from infected patients, Zhao Jincun, a respiratory expert at the State Key Laboratory, told reporters in Guangdong on Saturday.
The team of scientists had previously sa id the virus, in addition to being carried in respiratory droplets, appeared to be transmissible through fecal matter, underscoring the need to practice good hand washing as a preventive measure.
Zhao did not directly say that the virus could be transmitted through urine, simply noting that the strains had been isolated and that this had implications for public health control. They are continuing to work
on isolating the virus and on a cure, the Guangzhou Daily reported.
But he said people should pay more attention to personal and family hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus and recommended frequently washing hands, closing the toilet lid before flushing and making sure bathroom drains are not blocked.

WHO experts have also been on an investigative mission in China this week, holding meetings in Beijing and traveling to the provinces of Sichuan and Guangdong. But they had not been scheduled to travel to Wuhan, where the outbreak began at a live animal market and which remains under strict lockdown in an effort to contain the virus.
This had led to speculation that the Chinese government, which has come under fire for its slow response to the outbreak and where medical workers are stretched to the limit, did not want the experts to visit.
But the WHO said late Friday that the experts would be traveling to the center of the outbreak on Saturday, although they gave no further information about their itinerary .

Dear Francis
As you may know, the National Symphony Orchestra has long had an Asia your on its schedule for March this year, leaving in just two weeks or so. The China portion of the tour was cancelled a few weeks ago but the Japan portion of the trip has been sustained. Now, with increased focus on Japan, some of the members and our management are looking for additional advice on travel concerns and any infectious disease warning/direction. Would you have someone amongst your brilliant colleagues who could be a resource to our team?

Ihave included Gary Ginstling on this email as he is our Executive Director of the NSO. Thank you so much for any direction you can offer us!

Subject:Covid-19 Survival on Surfaces

Dear A nne and Tony,


Iam sorry to bother you, but Iam hoping that you can direct me to anyone at NIAID or CDC who is working on the survival of Covid-19 on surfaces. This could include shipping boxes, but also on various products and other perishable items. The food safety people here at FDA are quite concerned about the latter, given published reports of differential coronavirus survival on various surfaces.

If it turns out that this has not been evaluated, or is not in the process of being evaluated, we are happy to work on this in our BSL-3 labs, which are now in receipt of the virus.

Thanks so much for any direction that you can provide.


Best Regards, Peter

Subject: Rapid instrument-free NAAT for COVID-19

Dear Tony,


In addition to my role as a Stanford Medical School professor, I am the Chief Medical Officer of Visby Medical, a relatively new Silicon Valley diagnostics company focused on rapid detection of infectious agents. Visby Medical has developed a rapid ( 25 min sample-to-answer)  palm-sized, 40 cycle PCR (or RT-PCR) single-use device that does not require an instrument; it is used once, and then discarded or recycled.	(b)(4)




device is stable at room temperature for up to two years and thus it could be deployed widely.

We are seriously considering using this platform to develop a rapid test to detect COVID-19. Proof of principles that have been achieved toward that end are our demonstration that the device can use two-step RT-PCR to detect influenza A and Bin NP swab samples. The main features of the device are described in the brief accompanying PDF.

I write now because we are unsure, if we were to produce a COVID-19 device, how it would be deployed, by whom it would be used and who might be willing to purchase it. I would be very grateful if you might be able to speak briefly with me and my colleagues about these open questions. I am convinced this device can meet a major unmet need in clinical care and disease control for this epidemic and we, as a group, want to make a difference. Your advice would be invaluable as we weigh the risks and benefits of pivoting the company to this application.

With all best wishes; I hope all is well with you and your family.
gary

Dear Dr. Fauci,




You have been kind enough to be a panelist on our Forums at the Harva rd T.H . Chan School of Public Health,and I wanted to see if you were available to participate remotely in a Fomm that we are organizing on March 2 about COVID-19.




The Forum will live stream on the websites of The World and The Forum, as well as on
Facebook and YouTube.




The World will send a jou rnalist to moderate and co-promote.




The Forum is called "The Coronavirus Outbreak: Tracking COVID-19" ,presented jointly with The World from PRX & WGBH.



Should you agree to pa1ticipate, we ask that you join us remotely from 11:40am-lpm ET on March 2; the actual live webcast will be noon-1pm ET.




We have been active is covering this OLltbreak. We did a highly successful Facebook Live Q&A
last week and are doing another Q&A next week.




As a reminder, Forum webcasts are one-hour long and are panel discussions, typically with 3-4 panelists, plus a moderator. A<i noted, these discussions are live streamed from our Leadership Studio at our school in front of a studio audience (about 40 seats) and an online aud ience. Anyone  with an Internet connection  can watch  the live webcasts; no registration  or fee is required.

Previous speakers in The Forum series have included Gina McCarthy, former EPA Administrator; Anthony Foxx, then U.S. Secretary of Transportation ; Eric Holder, then U.S. Attorney General; Kathleen Sebelius, then U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services; Gordon Brown, former UK Prime Minister; as well as numerous former governors and key public health policymak ers and officials from a range of public and private sector entities.

The Forum live webcasts are also streamed on The Forum website, where they are accompanied by a live chat and online commenting, and on facebook and YouTube. These webcasts are later posted as on-demand videos to our site and to Harvard's YouTube and iTunesU channels . We also make available podcasts, transcripts  and other materials.
Collectively, the programs and complementary content have resulted in nearly five million
viewer engagements so far, and our website has received visits from more tban 200 countries and

Iam very distressed by the Face of the WHO. Their public face, their news updates, are of the qual ity of those of a third world country.Ionly hope that they funct ion better than their news updates suggest. They need a world class public relations firm.

Iam deeply concerned re Covid-19 in India (with a population of 1500 million) and Africa (population 100 million). News reports do not mention anything of this pandemic waiting to happen.
Hope that you are well and getting a good night's rest. Best,

Subject: for review: proposed responses for Italian media request Dr. Fauci -
This is not urgent for today.A reporter from the Italian health website Pazienti.it reached out to you directly with questions about coronavirus vaccine development. I have drafted proposed responses for your review attached and pasted below. Iwill send the final responses to the reporter attributed to you. Coronavirus vaccine :when will it be available? What are the difficulties?
The National Institutes of Health is on track to test an experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in a Phase 1clinical trial this spring. This first phase of clinicaltesting will involve giving the vaccine to healthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in recipients. It is importa nt to realize that the development of investigational vaccines and the clinical
testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes time. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will
likely not be widely available for at least a year.

Could the Coronavirus mutate, if a vaccine cannot be found in time?
We are learning more about the novel coronavirus every day .At this time,we are not aware of any mutations that might affect vaccine development .Based on our experience with other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is unlikely-but not impossible -that the novel coronavirus will mutate in a way that would have an impact on the development of medical countermeasures .We are continuing to monitor this.
Will the vaccine be the solution against Coronavirus?
A safe and effective vaccine would be an extremely valuable tool to help stop the spread of infection and prevent future outbreaks. However, proven public health practices of identifying cases, isolating patients, and tracing contacts must continue alongside a vaccination program.
Thanks,
Jen

Subject:RE: Institutional request for  information Dear Dr. Fried,
Answers to your questions are below .


1. Is the CDC or NIH overseeingthe distribution of the live virus in the U.S.?
There is an interagency working group convened by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response oversee ing samples, and NIH and CDC are central to this.Virus is being deposited in BEi Resources (a NIAID contract resource) for characterization, growth and distribution. The WA isolate is available now and a Hong Kong isolate may be added soon.

2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the U.S.,or will institutions be permitted to obtain it directly from other sources?
Assuming appropriate permits are in place, there is no limitation on an institution obtaining samples directly from BEi or other sources. In a public health emergency, the U.S. government seeks to make isolates available under a Simple Letter Agreement that does not impose IP restrictions on academics or developers (see attached language).

3. If it can be obtained from other sources, what sources will be permitted? For example, the China or Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong?
Assuming appropriate permits and safety controls, there is no limitation on from where samples can be obtained. However, there may be intellectual property restrictions from some sources and your technology transfer office would need to negotiate if requested directly.

4. If you are to be the sole source,when would you expect to have a process for considering
requests?
BEi resources already has a process for sharing in place and is currently sharingthe viral isolate obtained from the first Washington case. NIAID anticipates that other viral isolates will be obtained soon, and BEi is committed to making those available to the scientif ic community as soon as

possible. We (NIAID/ USG) do not expect to be the only source, but will likely be one of the main
sources for this research resource based on experience with Zika.

5. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions other than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course  subject to change over time)?
For that, contacting CDC directly would make sense. If you would like us to inquire, we can. For high
    consequence viruses, use of proper PPE has been a mitigating factor in quarantine consideration. Please feel free to contact me if you have additional questions.
Thanks,
Alan

Linda:
 There is a "sample sharing" working group involving NIH and CDC.	I have copied both Hilary Marston and Alan Embry from NIAID who are involved in this group and will ask them by this e-mail to respond to items #1through 4. Regarding returning travelers from China (item #5) if in Wuhan (Hubei province) within previous 14 days, they submit to institutional quarantine;if in non-Hubei province part of China, then they face self-isolation.
  Hope that this is helpful. Best regards,
Tony

Subject:Institutional request for information


Dear Ors. Redfield and Fauci,


Iam writing on behalf of Columbia University, which has received a request from Dr. Ian Lipkin to transfer live novel coronavirus from Hong Kong to his BSL3 facility at the University. As we evaluate his request, we note that he has approval from a CDC official to import the virus (see attached).  However, as we consider the risks and benefits of Dr. Lipkin's proposal, we ask the two of you:

1. Is the CDC or NIH overseeing the distribution of the live virus in the U.S.?
2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the U.S., or will institutions be permitted to obtain it directly from other sources ?
3. If it can be obtained from other sources, what sources will be permitted? For example, the
China or Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong?
4. If you are to be the sole source, when would you expect to have a process for considering requests?
5. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions
other than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over
time)?


Thank you very much for your help with these important questions as we all try to do our best to contribute solutions to this health crisis.

With best regards,
Linda

Dr. Fauci,

The nation again is fo1iunate to have your leadership for this latest public health emergency . Thank you for all you are doing. I know you are extraord inarily busy, so I'll be brief.

I want to introduce you to MlT Sloan Professor Andrew Lo, a world leader in healthca re finance who has focused much of bis work recently on accelerating biomedical  innovation via novel financing structures.  I have worked with him to explore financial engineering approaches to establish more durable public-private partnerships  for medical countermeasures.  The persistent challenges you articulated at the Aspen Institute event this week resonate loudly with Andrew and me.

He has  proposal for COVID-19 that be wou1d like to present to you.  I defer to him to provide fmtber information.

Good Evening,

This is Melanie Starling writing on behalf of PBS'S FIRING LINE WITH MARGARET HOOVER .


FIRING LINE is the rare program in the political landscape that seeks a rigorous and earnest exchange of ideas, with the luxury to let the conversation breathe. Margaret has brought back the spirit of this venerated show, which aired from 1966 to 1999, that is lacking in today's polarized cable news ecosystem - at a time when we need it more than ever. One guest. 30 minutes. Airing to a thoughtful and engaged PBS audience.


We would be honored to have Dr. Anthony S. Fauci join Firing line for an
interview.


Dr. Fauci has dedicated his career to understanding, preventing, and protecting people across the globe from infectious diseases, which is why we would be so honored to share our stage with him at this time. As the coronavirus continues to spread, we are interested in better understanding the deadly virus the world is racing to contain. Equally, we are interested in highlighting any other public health issues or policies close to Dr. Fauci's heart. Most importantly, with our program, we have the luxury of time-where we can truly delve into these issues in a substantive, nuanced manner that is missing in much of today's 24-hour news cycle.


THE  DETAILS FOR TAPING

TAPE DATE: TARGETING FEBRUARY 19TH - EVENING TAPING IS PREFERED TAPE TIME:  45 MINUTES
LOCATION: NYC (WNET STUDIOS NEAR LINCOLN CENTER)
TRAVEL, HAIR, & MAKE-UP IS PROVIDED ON REQUEST.


FIRING LINE is carr ied nationwide on PBS with 99% market pick-up, and is suggested programming for PBS's 8:30 PM ET on Friday nights with multiple airings through the week.  On Twitter, we have a growing 2.9M+ monthly impressions.  Equally, as you know, PBS remains a coveted home for intellectual, elevated programming- and stands out as a top 5 outlet to reach persuadable voters .

HIGHLIGHT REEL



FIRING LINE is produced by the Oscar-nominated Tom Yellin at The Documentary Group. Please reach out to me if there is any interest.  We will bend over backwards to get it done.

ABOUT FIRING LINE WITH MARGARET HOOVER
Firing Line with Margaret Hoover is a refreshing reprisal of William F. Buckley's iconic PBS program, a smart, civil and engaging contest of ideas. The series maintains the character of the original, providing a platform that is diligent in its commitment to civility and the rigorous exchange of opinion. Firing Line with Margaret Hoover comes at a time when meaningful discourse is needed more than ever . Interviews and debates will highlight leading lights from the left and right, complemented by archiva l footage from the original Firing Line to remind viewers of longstanding conservative and liberal arguments, where they've been disproved or reinforced over time. It is an opportunity to engage in the debate about the America that we want to create for the 21st century - and summon Americans of every politica l persuasion to a rigorous examination of the choices we must make together in the challenging years ahead. Showrunner is Emmy, Dupont and Murrow-winning producer A lyssa Litoff.

Hi, Patty -


Exec Sec would like Dr. Fauci's opinion on whether Dr. Collins should accept the attached invitation to speak at an upcoming Coronavirus Preparedness Summit & Workshop being held this June in Washington, DC. The conference is being organized by Syllabusx, a group of "international specialists in public health and emergency planning events and disaster recovery conferences."

Given the nature of the conference topics, do you concur with recommending Dr. Collins decline the invitation and refer to CDC?

Thanks for your input. Kara

Dear Dr. Fauci,


Jon Banner here. You may remember me from my days at ABC News, where I was Executive Producer of World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, Charlie Gibson, and Diane Sawyer. Iwas also Executive Producer of This Week with George Stephanopoulos and early on Iwas George Strait's producer. Back then, you were the most engaging, eloquent guests on the subject of HIV/AIDS and other life and death issues of our time, and your input was of enormous value to our viewers and the general public.

Today, I am President of the PepsiCo Foundation and EVP of Global Communications for the company . I was hoping you could help us identify an expert to provide similar insight and analysis for our company as we deal with the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus.While we would of course welcome your counsel, I recognize that you have a full plate of critical responsibilit ies with NIH and don't want to take up too much of your time.

If you have a few minutes for a quick call, I'd love to get your take and catch up. If not,Iwould deeply appreciate it if you could connect me with another expert over email.


Thanks very much, and hope you are doing well! Warm regards,
Jon

Dear Drs. Redfield and Fauci,

Iam writing on behalf of Columbia University, which has received a request from Dr. Ian Lipkin to transfer live novel coronavirus from Hong Kong to his BSL3 facility at the University. As we evaluate his request, we note that he has approval from a CDC official to import the virus (see attached) . However, as we consider the risks and benefits of Dr. Lipkin's proposal, we ask the two of you:

1. Is the CDC or NIH overseeing the distribution of the live virus in the U.S.?
2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the U.S., or will institutions be permitted to obtain
it directly from other sources?
3. If it can be obtained from other sources, what sources will be permitted? For example, the China or Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong?
4. If you are to be the sole source, when would you expect to have a process for considering requests?

5. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions other than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over time)?

Thank you very much for your help with these important questions as we all try to do our best to contribute solutions to this health crisis.

With best regards, Linda

Hi Dr. Fauci : I saw that you spoke about the lack of major drugmakers stepping up to make coronavirus vaccine , and my colleague James Paton is working on a story about that issue . James 's story has to do with a biosecurity initiative related to these types of threats at GSK that was started in 2016 and quickly put on the back burner . Idon't know whether you'd want to comment on the company or its activities itself, but would be helpful if you could talk about the importance of getting big drugmakers involved in helping to fill the need for new vaccines .

Hi Dr . Fauci : How are you? I 'm writing to see
whether we can talk again for a few minutes .
We 're working on a biggish piece about the
larger bio-security issue worldwide and what the coronavi rus outbreak tells us about it . What can we do about the weakest links in disease control in poorer nations in Africa, Asia and elsewhere?
The WHO today brought up the importance of
access to health care along with spending on
public health, and clearly this is an issue in poor coun ties . Is it also important in infectious disease in the US  and if so, is it adequately recognized? Companies and research centers have made huge strides in quic k development of vaccines and drugs; what can take it to the next level? Is there anyth ing that could be done to attract more companies to this
field? What kind of new technologies can help us
track new viruses in the community? I've been talking with people using handheld nanopore sequencers to track coronavirus and Ebola ; what else is out there? Do we need to do a better job of tracking the movement of people and goods? Also glad to get any other observations. Please
give me a call today or tomorrow morning at

Iwanted to check back with you and Dr. Fauci on a few things in advance of his fireside
chat with David Rubenstein on Friday, February 21.



 Are there any articles that Dr. Fauci thinks would be useful to send out to our CEOs in advance of the discussion (it may be something related to the Coronavirus or something that looks at the futu re of health and what CEOs should be thinking about in the next decade?

 The theme for our upcoming meeting is "The Next Decade - Major trends in technology, geopolitic s, politics,economy and health" . I have attached a copy of our Draft CONFIDENTIAL and list of attendees for Dr. Fauci's reference .



 During his discussion with David Rubenstein, are there any slides he would like to use for reference?  We do not use a lot of these but thought there might be slides that would a id in his discussion? Just let us know.

Subject: epiqar for Coronavirus assistance

Dr. Fauci,


I wanted to reach out to see if epiqar (https://epigar.com/) can help your efforts with the Coronavirus- we are the only system in the world built for remote surgical help & interactive emergency surgeon support over the web browser.

epiqar has created the most advanced surgical video collaboration technology, allowing surgeons to consult and train remotely on a low-cost and easy-to-use online surgical collaboration platform and Cloud-archiving system built for the operating room. With the outbreak of Coronavirus, this has become more vital as surgeon mobility and access to critical surgical spaces in need of more help are severely limited, and specialists will not risk entering spreading viral hot zones.

Patient care isn't just a concern with the virus itself, but with the host of medical issues facing patients that will no longer be treated by local specialists easily, and facing caregivers: surgeon involvement from around the world is needed urgently.

Although epiqar is an American company, our rollout in recent months has been in
France, making selected French institutions the most prepared in the world for remote video care. We obviously weren't anticipating the Coronavirus and now we're dedicated to delivering our technology to where the wor ld needs it asap.

epiqar's parent company ENGAUGE (https://eng.us/) is a state-of-the-art online healthcare company for surgeon training and has served clients such as Johnson & Johnson , Intuitive Surgical, and many other of the world largest & smallest medical device companies. ENGAUGE has helped surgeons all over the world have access to secure online training that has improved their understanding of the innovations in robotics and many of the latest surgical techniques and medical devices for best patient care.

I've linked a whitepaper below with details of the system's use. Please let me know if you would like to speak further and/or need anything additional.



Thanks,

Dear Dr. Fauci,


My name is Sara Berg and Iam a senior writer for the AMA. I am reaching out to you today because you have shared a lot of great information about COVID-19 with the JAMA network. Iknow you are very busy, but Iwas wondering if you would be available tomorrow or Thursday for a quick phone interview about what to tell patients who suspect they have COVID-19? This would be an AMA news article for physicians about what to tell patients. The CDC has a list of preventive steps:
https://www .cdc.gov/coro navirus/2019-ncov/hcp/gu idance-prevent-spread.html.


This would be what physicians should tell patients who suspect they have COVID-19. One tip might be
"Call before you come in." Do you think this is something you would be available to participate in?


I look forward to hearing from you.



Thank you,

AMA

Dear Dr. Fauci,

We would be most appreciative if you would take just a few moments to review what we have written for accuracy and content.  Please share any comments or suggestions for changes you may have on the article.

In order to incorporate your comments into the final Letter, please let me hear from you by Monday, Feb. 17th. I can be reached by email jnieman@Pletter.com or phone (402) 660-4715.

I look forward to your reply.




INFECTION  CONTROL




       The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus will raise questions about how to limit the spread of respiratory infections .

       Managing this situation is similar to outbreaks of SARS and MERS ...since coronaviruses are spread by respiratory secretions .

Put the risk in perspect ive to calm worried
patients ...since it doesn 't come close to the risk of influenza .



For example, over 35 MILLION U.S. patients got the flu last
season ...with about 500,000 hospita lizations and 34,000 deaths .



Emphasize getting a flu vaccine each year .

       And use this coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to stress infection control ...since there 's no treatment or vaccine yet .

       Reinforce proper hand hygiene . Educate that handwashing with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs .	Advise washing for 20 seconds ...about the time it takes to sing the ABC song .

       Or recommend using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if handwashing isn't practical .	Many products contain this much.

       But tell patients to be wary of efficacy claims .	For example, hand sanitizers are shown to kill enveloped viruses . Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses ...but they aren 't specifically studied .

       Tell patients to avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth .

       Clear up confusion about mas ks.	Emphasize that mas ks are for SICK patients ...to help keep their germs from getting into the air .

       But discourage surgical masks for mos t patients withOUT symptoms ...there's no evidence they help .	They 're too loose to limit inhaling germs ...and viruses can also get in through the eyes .

       If patients ask about N95 respirators, tell them these require fitting and training before use .	Save them for healthcare workers .

       Caution that unnecessary mask use may contribute to shortages .

       Continue to ask patients WITH respiratory symptoms to put a surgica l mask on when they come to clinic .

       And suggest that sick patients wear a mask at home if in close contact with infants , elderly , or irnrnunocompromised patients .

Tell patients to discard masks when damp ...and to use a
fresh one at least daily .

Encourage pat ients to stay home when they're sick.

If this is true, which it might not be, there is no clear explanation for why right now.  There will likely be studies comi ng out that say that the relative proportion of male:female is closer to 50:50.	Even one of the ones that you quoted was
54%

Subject:Interview re: coronavirus patient characteristics Hi Dr Fauci,
I'm sure you're extraordinarily busy right now,but I've seen several studies and reports that coronavirus
seems to disproportionately strike men (making up 54-68% of cases, depend ing on which study you
reference). Iwas wonder ing if you might have any comments to offer on why this might be?

Dear Tony,
Ident mean to bother you, but Ihave a suggestion, in case you have not
considered it.
China will have hundreds of thousands of Coronavirus survivors. Their convalescent (immune) serum is valuable. China should try to collect it and give it as a good-will gesture to people around the world.
For moderately to seriously ill people, Immune serum should save many lives.
If cases start to come here, we also should collect serum from survivors, but hopefully we will be very late in the pandemic, and it is not needed because of all of the others things you are doing.
Thank you for everything you and NIAID are doing!
Best wishes, Marty
(Just as in SARS, the Ro for nCo-2019 is higher in hospitals than in the community,
but it still is too high in the community) .

Dear Tony,




Thanks for your JAMA piece on 2019-nCoV.  Perhaps I can help in a small way:




In 2003, with SARS, the Ro was initiaJly considered to be over 2, but in fact that was the conflation of the nosocomia l and community rates. In the 2004 paper, we showed that nosocomial rate was much higher, and that the Ro inthe community was between 1 and 2. A lower Ro in the community accounts for why moderate public health actions could move it toward extinction--and why it propagated in Beijing, but not Shanghai, in Toronto

but not in Vancouver--the Ro in North America became less than
one pretty quickly.




To me, one important aspect is the control of respiratory transmission in the hospital, avoiding extensive nebulization/aerosolization,  or doing so in negative pressure rooms, as for TB isolation.

(Treating patients with robots is a good idea!)




In the community, standard public health quarantine , contact tracing should be sufficient for starters.




Although hundreds of cases are reported in China, the actual number of infections is likely much higher. The 41 deaths are the tip of the iceberg of not 800 infections (5% fatality rate), but maybe 8,000 infections (0.5%). Although that rate is much better, if the mutating virus becomes very contagious-then the impact could be similar to 1918 flu. That's why containment is so important-and although draconian, the Chinese goverrunent is doing the right thing (as far as we know).




When a new pathogen arrives, children often have mild disease but they are important vectors for transmission in the community, reaching many households. The second paper is the importance of closing schools to minimize transmission-This was for flu with a short (pre-symptomatic) incubation, but may be even more relevant for 2019-nCoV. It is much too early to even think of this in the USA, but it may come to this--and sooner will be better than later, when that time point comes.




Happy to help, any way that I can. Thank you for all you and NIAID are doing!!!




Best wishes , Marty

Holbrook, Michael

Subject: coronaviruses

Hello,

Working as an occupational physician in F1ance, Iwould  l ike to draw your attention to the antiviral activity of proton pump inhibitors , including for the Gibbon Ape Leukemia vims, a virus which does not require acidification of endosomes for entry  into cells, as is the case with coronaviruses.

Indeed, in 2015 Long et al. ( l) found that« ...The commonly used proton pump inhibitors, Omeprazol e and Esomeprazole were also able to inhibit entry of all PVs tested but at higher drug concentrations than may be achieved in vivo ... ».
Us ing omeprazole and esomepra zole magnesium hydrate, prepared in steril e DMSO (Sigm a), they concluded tha t«
... OM and ESOM appeared  to decrease tluorescence, and therefore increase endosomal  pH, only at a concentration of200µM, higher than that required  to inhibit PV entry. Moreover cellular toxicity was observed at this concentration  after 24 hours... ».

In2016, Dowall et al. (2) found : « ...Whereas omeprazole and esomeprazole demonstrated in vitro activity against EBOV, the results were in line with a previous report using pseudotyped viruses where the values of drug concentration causing 50% inhibition (ICSO) were in the region of 50 µM [10). This suggested that doses required for potent inhibition would be difficult to achieve without concomitant and significant toxicity (the licenced dosing for 40 mg esomeprazole , 20 mg esomeprazole and 20 mg omeprazole generates median maximum plasma concentrations of  1.59-9.61  tM, 0.5 J.78 µMand 0.15-3.5 I  µM, respectively ... >}.

However, omeprazole is marketed in a non-ionize.d form and must be ionized (in acidic environment) to be

transformed into an active molecule(3). lt is the ionized form which establishes covalent bonds with the SH group of the cysteine of the a subunit of the proton pump.
The solution used in 2015 by Jason Long et al. was. as in 2016 by Dowa ll et al., DMSO(Dimethyl Sulfoxide). DMSO is a polar and aprotic organic solvent with dissociation constant pKa = 35.1 This is probably an explanation for the surprising findings from these studies regarding proton pump inhibitors: Inh ibition of viruses at 100 µM (at 50 µM esomeprazo le for 4 of the 5 viruses tested) and increase in endosomal pH only at a concentrat ion of200 µM.


This is a situation which, from my point of view, does not reflect the human tissue situation, because in this situation
omeprazole can be ionized in the intracellular space but also already in the extracellu lar space.
Besides, that's probably its advantage: to be ionized and activated where there is an acidic environment.

Without taking into account the tissue situation and the need that omeprazole must be ionized to be transformed into an active molecule, it would not be possible to explain the following pub lications, since it would be impossible to obtain tissue concentrations required:

«Proton pump inhibitors as anti vacuolar-ATPases drugs: a novel anticancer strategy» (4)




(5)

« Anti-Rhinovirus activity of lansoprazole, which was probably due to an endosomal anti-acidic mechanism»

« PPls exert an antiviral function by effectively inhibiting virus-specific serine proteases» (7)

     « V-ATPase as a cand idate target molecule or biomarker for cancer treatment and provide a potential role for omeprazole as a chemosensitizer in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary» (12)

     « Proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, used clinically to suppress gastric acidity in gastritis, are activated by acidic conditions and tend to decrease intracellular pH and increase the extracellular pH via inhibition ofV-ATPases in a covalent interaction» (13)

«proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be highly effective at inhibiting V-ATPases in vitro>> (14)


Specifically at the pulmonary level, we observe concerning proton pump inhibitors:

     « ...Since ATP l2A shares approximately 65% identity with the gastric H+!K+-ATPase (ATP4A), we investigated the potential of usi ng clin ica lly approved ATP4A proton pump inhibitors (PPis) for their abil ity to restore ASL pH in CF hAECs. We show that, despite not expressing ATP4A transcripts, acute exposure to the PPJ esomeprezo le, produced changes in intracellu lar pH that were consistent with the inh ibition ofH+ secretion , but th is response was independent of ATP l 2A. More importantly , chronic exposw-e of CF hAECs to esomeprazo le alkalinized the ASL w ithout disrupting the epithe lial barrier integrity, but this increase in ASL pH was consistent
w ith a decrease in mRNA expression of ATPJ 2A. We conclude that PPis may offer a new approach to restore ASL pH in CF airways, which  is independent ofCFTR . . .. » (15)

     « ...On the other band, even though the gastric H+/K+-ATPase was not expressed  in airway epithelial cells, exposure to esomeprazole acidifie.d the cytosol and increased ASL pH of primary CF hAECs. We show that esomeprazo le had a dual mechanism of action: acutely, it induced intracellular acidification  in an ATP I2A­ independent manner but, chronic exposure, which importantly did not have any deleterious effect on epithel ial integrity, was linked to decreased ATP!2A mRNA  levels. These results open up the possibility ofrepurpos ing PPTs as a new therapeut ic approach for treating CF lung disease... » (15)

      « ...we found that the mRNA of ATP I2A, the non-gastric H+/K+-ATPase, shares 70% identity with tbe gastric I-I+/K+-ATPase, ATP4A mRNA, which translates to around 65% identity in the protein products ... » (15)

Regarding coronaviruses and Golgi complex:

     « ...Coronaviruses (CoVs) acquire their envelopes from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (...), also called the cis-Golgi network( ...). The three main envelope proteins (S, Mand E) are synthesized in the ER and move to the ERGIC/Golgi region where they orchestrate assembly of virus by interacting with the viral nucleocapsid (...). Once virions have budded into the lumen of the ERGlC, the -120 nm particles must move through the host secretory pathway to be released from infected cells. Coronaviruses are believed to follow the constitutive secretory pathway for exocytosis, although onl y a few studi es have addressed the release of virions. During infection , a progressive disruption of Golgi structure is observed, with swollen unstacked cisternae late in infection ... ))
« ...Weak bases (which disrupt acidification), v-ATPase inhibitors, and expression of a pH activated proton channel al Iblock a number of membrane trafficking steps (...) One mechanism for how lumin al pH can affect vesicular trafficking involves a subunit of the membrane sector of the v-ATPase, which has been shown to act as a pH sensor
in endosomes. This subunit Lmdergoes a conformational change as the luminal pH drops, wh ich recrui ts cytoplasm ic
machinery leading to subsequent vesicle formation ... )) (19)

     « ...Phannacological and other manipulations of the pH gradient that result in neutralization of the lumen h ave all been shown to cause slow trafficking of cargo thro ugh the Golgi complex as well as alteration in Golgi morphology ... »
« ...Similar to M2, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) coronavirus E protein elicits mu ltiple secretory pathway disruption phenotypes when overexpressed in mammalian cells... » (20)

     « ...The envelope protein (E) of coronaviruses plays an important role in virus assembly (...) Using coronavirus infectious clones, it was shown that the transmissible gastroenteritis virus E protein is essential for virus production , and murine hepatitis virus lacking E protein is viable but extremely debilitated ... »
« ...The exact mechanism of coronavirus release after budding into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment is not known. Large vacuoles containing budded virions are observed in infected cells, presumably en route to the plasma membrane where fusion of the vacuole results in release ofvirions ... » (21, 22)

      « ...It might be worth investigating whether ion-channel inhibitors, such as amantadine, or proton pump inhibitors specifica lly are able to inhibit this increase in Golgi pH. For now, though, it still remains to be seen w h ether CoV release is mediated by viropor in ion channel activi ty or through PPis w ith host proteins of the secretory pathway ... )> (23)

      « V-ATPases are also important for transportation  of newly synthesized acid hydrolases from Golgi to lysosomes » (24)

     «...cardiotonic steroids ouabain and bufalin , which are known not to affe.ct the transport function ofNa+,K+­ ATPase, inhibited infection of cells with MHY, FlPV , Middle East respiratory  syndrome (MERS)-CoV , and YSV , but not TA V, when the compounds were present during virus inoculation. Cardiotonic steroids were shown to inhibit entry ofMHV at an early stage, resulting  in accumulation  ofvirions close to the cell surface and, as a consequence, in reduced fusion. In agreement with an early block in infection , the inhibition ofVSV by CTSs could be bypassed by low-pH shock. Viral RNA replication was not affected when these compounds were added after virus entry. The antiviral effect of ouabain could be relieved by the addition of different Src kinase inhibitors. indicating that Src signaling mediated via ATPIA I plays a crucial role in the inhibition of CoV and VSV infections ...» (25)



In conclusion, in order to verify the possible efficacy of omeprazole and esomeprazole in the control of infection by coronaviruses :

     The equivalent of the maximum sernm concentration that can be obtained in the human body should be used and tested in active (ionized) form in vitro.
Unlike an in vitro test, the human body is an open system, a dissipative system. However, local concentrations of the ionized form should not exceed sernm concentrations of the inactive non-ionized form in the absence of active transport.
But the transformation from the non-ionized form to the ionized form could continue until the saturation of the reactions at the cellular level or until the depletion of the transformation capacity from the inactive form to an active form, linked to a change in acidity or the depletion of the inactive form.

     As omeprazole can modify or even inhibit the action of the M2 protein of the influenza virus at the cellular level (26), based on a computer simulation test, it would be desirable to check the interaction capabilities of omeprazol e with protein E of the coronavirus. Protein E is likely to resemble the protein M2 in its mode of action.

     Tn the absence of a treatment recognized as effective in the context of a coronavirus infection and in the absence of data clearly demonstrating the ineffectiveness of omeprazole, personally , T would be tempted to take omeprazol e after being in contact (at a distance ofless than 2 to 3 meters) with peopl e at risk of contamination or ifl had the first symptoms, hoping for the inhibitory activity of omeprazole on P-type ATPases (27, 28) in the context
of coronavirus exocytosis, in analogy to the action "off target on the endosomal vATPase" during endocytosis
processes.
This step, if effective, will not prevent infection, but could Jessen its importance, slow the process down and give the
.immune system a complementary option to defend itself...


     Personal experience, using omeprazole in the context of seasonal respiratory viral infections since 2007, reminds me of the indication to divide the daily dose into two daily doses (omeprazole lOmg morning and evening is usually already effective for seasonal respiratory viral infections). According to the evolution and the importance of inflammatory state I associate an antihistamine , eg cetirizine.

ln the context of the coronavirus, l would be tempted

     share the maximum permissible daily dose of omeprazole in 3 divided doses after being in contact with people at risk of contamination at a distance of less than 2 to 3 meters

divide the daily dose of omeprazole into two daily doses in case of minor symptoms

     take the daily dose of omeprazole in a single dose if the symptoms worsen with repercussions on the general condition

to resume the daily dose of omeprazole in two daily doses when the symptoms of severity diminish.


The effectiveness of esomeprazole may be greater than omeprazole.



Taking into account the aforementioned publications, it should not be forgotten that omeprazo le will reduce secretions at the respiratory level. A positive effect on respiratory secretions during acute v iral respiratory diseases w hich can become negative (by modifying the pH, the ciliary m obility and the volume of secretions) during prolonged use, thus promoting the risk of bacterial pneumonia (29).
The advantages and disadvantages may vary depending on the user phenotype of omeprazole with regard to cytochrome P 450 (30).

Assistant editor and Opinions contributor Feb. 10, 2020 at 2:22 p.m. EST
The latest strain of coronavirus continues to rage across China. Its death tolf has surpassed 900, eclipsing the body count from China's SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003.
To get a better sense of the disease and the U.S. government's response to it, we spoke to Anthony S. Fauci, immunologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Below is a transcript of an interview with Fauci, edited for clarity and brevity.
Robert Gebelhoff :Right off the bat, what makes this virus different?
Anthony Fauci: Well, we have to be concerned whenever there's a virus that has - and I'm going to use a big word here - pathogenic potential. ... [The coronavirus] is brand-new,and there's no real underlying experience with it,so the general population is naive with regard to protection. And it has serious potential, because it's already spreading rapidly. It's the unknown aspect of something that already tells you it's a serious problem. We don't know where it's going.

Gebelhoff : Are we past the point of containment for this coronavirus?
Fauci: No, we're not. The short answer is we're not past the point of containment. But it really does have the potential to turn into a global pandemic.What we have now is a very serious epidemic in China. ... [But outside of China,] there is very little - but some - transmission from person to person. Once you get multiple countries that have sustained transmission from person to person, then it's beyond the situation where you can contain it. You can only mitigate it.
In the United States, we are clearly in the containment phase.... And what we've done is we've identified.We've isolated. And we've done contact-tracing [identifying who might have come in contact with an infected person]. That seems to be successful. But once it it starts spreading all over the world ... then it's almost inevitable that it's going to start spreading here.
Gebelhoff: The Post reported last week that China withheld information from the public, including silencing medical professionals, and that this made the spread of the virus worse . How does the United States work with a government that we can't even trust to tell the truth to its people?

Fauci: That is an issue. And it's the reason why I have been saying that we need some of our people - CDC, NIH people - there on the ground, both helping and seeing with their own eyes exactly the extent of this. We want to be part of a [World Health Organizat ion] convening group that goes there. But thus far, we've not been able to make that a reality.
Gebelhoff: And why's that?
Fauci: Idon't know.We have asked. We have colleagues - scientific colleagues - in China that we've dealt with for years if not decades. Many of them have trained in the United States. And we know them as friends and as colleagues. They are the ones that are not holding back.... But they're not the ones  that make the official proclamations of what comes out. The solution to the problem in the question you're posing is that we really do want people there, so that we can not only help them but also provide some expertise that might supplement or complement their own expertise .
Gebelhoff: What does the United States do if [the coronavirus] does become a pandemic in the developing world?
Fauci: Well obviously we will try to help them to contain as best as possible. ... Right now, by definition, it is not truly a global pandemic . It is a very serious outbreak and epidemic in China, but the amount of sustained transmission outside of China is still minimal. ... But there are some countries where it is going to be very difficult to stop the evolution into sustained transmission. Obviously the [World Health Organization] and the global security network that we put up over the years will try to help those countries, but there's no guarantee that we'll be successful.
Gebelhoff: On that point, the head of the WHO has criti cized travel bans and restrictions around the world as not helpful to stopping the outbreak. He said it was potentially "increasing fear and stigma." What
Fauci: Everyone agrees that travel bans and restrictions are almost never successful in completely stopping something is that invariably going to turn into a pandemic.... What we are trying to do is to pause temporarily and give China enough time to put the lid on [this virus] to prevent it from becoming global and to give us a little more time to prepare. There's no indication or imagination that if this becomes a global pandemic that travel restrictions are going to mean anything. But they can mean something, as a temporizing activity.
Gebelhoff: What should the average person be doing right now about coronavirus?
Fauci: It's a good question. 1) They should realize at this point, it is a low risk. And 2) that risk can change, so pay attention to what's going on [and] to the ... announcements coming from the CDC. ... The things that you do for influenza - get vaccinated, wash your hands, avoid crowded places - are exactly the same things that you would do if we did get coronavirus here. So the question is,should we do anything different from what we're already doing? No. Should we all be wearing a mask? Absolutely
not.

Subject:Potential Treament Strategy to Reduce Motality Caused by Coronavirus Infection


Dear Dr. Fauci:


One effective way to get things done is through the individuals like you at the frontline with authorities . I know that you are very busy, and Iam sorry to bother you. You probably already knew what I'm going to say and appear to be so relaxed.

With the significant concern for the quick spread of coronavirus infection, Iwould like to propose a cell­ based immunomodulation strategy to reduce the "cytokine storm", the main pathophysiologcal cause for the mortality. The scientific rationale regarding this strategy has been partially discussed in an article entitled" Extending the Horizon of Cell Based lmmunotherapy by Understanding the Mechanisms of Action of Photopheresis" and other related articles on this topic.

Several potential treatment modality could be derived from this concept if more laboratory and clinical data support this motion, which include : (1) ozone therapy (withdraw about 50 ml -100 ml blood from patient in transfusion bag, mixing with small amount of ozo'ne ex vivo and re-infuse back to patient in 30 minutes); (2) Cupping therapy (medically induced subcutaneous hemorrhage by heat and vacuums effects) to expose self antigens to the abundant dendritic cells in the subcutaneous tissue in order to reinforce the self antigen tolerance . The best timing for these interventions in theory would be at the

period of fever, viremia stage. These simple approaches can be incorporated with the other medical treatments and supportive care.

I cannot be certain, but want to help as a holistic physician. Thank you very much for reading this email and providing your insight as well as help.



Sincerely,


Ching Y. Voss, M.D.

Dear Dr. Fauci,


The Trilateral Commission will hold its invitation-only annual plenary meeting in Washington, D.C., on March 13-15, 2020. Iwould like to invite you to participate in a conversation at the meeting on responding to the coronavirus and global pandemics.

As you may know, the Trilateral Commission was launched by David Rockefeller in 1973 to think through the shared challenges and leadership responsibilities of the three principal industrialized democratic areas of the world:  Europe, North American, and Japan [now Asia). Today, the Commission believes its original mission of bringing democratic countries together to tackle international challenges should once again be a major priority for our country and our partners.This year's plenary meeting is a major, three­ day gathering of our global membership during which we will explore the theme "Democracy and Capitalism at a Crossroads."


Your participation would make a great difference if you are available.Attached to this email you will find an invitation from North American chair Meghan O'Sullivan . Please do let us know if you have any questions about the event or your potential role in it, and we hope that you are able to accept our invitation .

Best wishes, Richard



Richard Fontaine
Executive Director
Trilateral Commission - North America

RE: Heat kills novel Coronavirus




Eric:
  The following is all on background.	Coronaviruses in general tend to circulate and infect predominantly in the winter season {Northern and Southern hemispheres have opposite seasons).   We do not know for sure why this is the case; however, many believe that the enclosed spaces in winter {mostly indoor because it is cold) allows better spread of a respiratory borne virus.   Also, some viruses tend to thrive in cold, dry weather as opposed to warm, moist weather. Remember, however, that when it is summer here, it is winter in Australia and Argentina.   This may be the genesis of the information given to President Xi and President Trump that the virus may "go away" in the warm weather.	However, this is a brand new virus with which we have no prior experience and it is entirely conceivable that seasonal changes will not have any impact on the spread.
Hope that this is helpful. Best,
Tony

Subject: Heat kills novel Coronavirus

Dr. Fauci:


We've been seeing a lot about people saying the heat will kill the novel coronavirus? Is this medically sound?

Trump discussed Coronavirus briefly: He said he had a long talk with President Xi two nights ago, and the Chinese president told him "the heat generally kills this kind of virus."

The president claimed the virus will go away in Apr il as the seasons change: "The virus that we're talking about having to do a lot of people. We think that goes away in April with the heat," he said.

Subject: "Coronavirus is airborne, Chinese officia l confirms"

Hi Tony ,
I need a Fauci brain dump. You may have seen this:
https: //www . nzherald . co. n z/wor ld/news/ article. cfm?c id=2&ob je ctid= 12307276

rs this news? Don't we already know  that the virus spread via droplei transmission? This article says aerosol transmission means "it can float a Jong distance to the air and cause infection later when it is breathed in ." That makes it sound Like the kind of spread that happens with measles, where the vinls can linger in a room and infect somebody 2 hours after somebody with measles leaves t.hc room.

Tomorrow, I will be giving an hour and a half of affiliate debriefings on this virus. So we wi ll be reaching millions of people. I'd love to get the latest and greatest public health message. Incidentally, Howard Zucker and the infectious disease folks at NYU Langone are very concerned about overloading our emergency rooms with patients who have upper respiratory infection symptoms. What is the right message? Ifsomebody calls thinking they have coronavims, do you tell them to come in -risking infection of others? Do they stay home and wait for symptoms to get worse? Of course, it would be great if you could send them a kit and happen to home testing. But that 's nowhere in the near future, right?

Thanks,
Jon

Hi Janelle


We can make this work - it would need to be from between 10 am - 1020 am hard stop.

Will that work?


It would need to be from our NIH Readycam studio with Videolink

of the U19 grant

_,Richard Whitley, M.D., Distinguished Professor at UAB and principal investigator

The investigational drug remdesivir, developed through research conducted through the A ntivi ral Drug Discovery and Development Cente r,or AD3C, and centered at the University of Alabama at Birmi ngham, is being used to treat select infected patients in the United States and in China who have been affected by the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
UAB was awarded a $37.5 million,five-year U19 grant from the National I nsti tute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases Centers of Excellence for Transl at i onal Research to study and develop treatment for high-priority emerging infections. Work has been taking place in earnest to develop drugs for emerging influenza, flaviviruses (dengue, West Nile virus and Zika),coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, and alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and chikungunya. The grant is a multi-

institutional collaboration to accelerate drug discovery for these emerging infections and is a public­ private partnership between academic institutions and Gilead Sciences.
Remdesivir, developed to treat the coronavirus causing MERS, was found to have significant activity against the 2019-nCoV strain when the outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Importantly, remdesivir had demonstrated efficacy in treating other medically important coronaviruses MERS and SARS in cell culture and animal models. Based on the compassionate plea requests of treating physicians in the United States, Gilead Sciences released remdesivir for use in a few patients, although the drug has not yet been tested for safety or efficacy in these diseases. "The release of remdesivir for safety and efficacy studies is a major accomplishment for the AD3C - namely the U19 grant - as it shows significant and swift advance of antiviral drugs to help treat and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks on an international scale and, importantly, to anticipate the introduction of these infections in the  United States," said Richard Whitley, M.D., Distinguished Professor at UAB and principal investigator of the U19 grant.
WATC H : UAB infecti ous disease experts provide informat i on on the 2019 novel coronavirus .
Gilead Sciences and supporting researchers and clinicians are working with health authorities from the World Health Organization and in China to establish a placebo-controlled study to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating 2019-nCoV .

"This is a prime example of how the research we are conducting at UAB plays a critical role in treating patients on a global scale and our contribution of substantial scientific advances."

-RichardWhitley,M.D.,UABDistinguished Professor

"The collaboration between UAB, our colleagues at Southern Research, Vanderbilt University and the University of North Carolina, along with our pharmaceutical partner Gilead Sciences, is indicative of our collaborative approach to respond to outbreaks in real time, and in helping communities worldwide fight 2019-nCoV. This is a prime example of how the research we are conducting at UAB plays a critical role in treating patients on a global scale and our contribution of substantial scientific advances," Whitley continued .
Whitley expressed that the potential for mutation of 2019-nCoV means that UAB's AD3C and partners will need to build backup molecules for potential testing and treatment in the near future.
The World Health Organization has declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a "public health emergency of
international concern."
UAB is the lead institution for AD3C and research conducted; but the team unifies scientists experienced in virology, viral immunology, pathogenesis, medicinal chemistry and translation to human disease from UAB, University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt University, Emory University, Washington University, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Southern Research, the Emory Institute of Drug Discovery, the University of Colorado, Denver,and Oregon Health & Science University.

Thanks for the note.  Ido not know enough about the plumbing system on the cruise ships to
make any meaningful comments, certa inly not any comments that could be attributable to me. And so, Iwill pass on this one, The best person to comment or opine on this wou ld be Mart Cetron of CDC. FYI, in case you do not have it in front of you, I am attach ing the original NEJM article on the Amoy  Gardens Apartment story in Hong Kong with SARS.

HI Dr. Fauci,


I hope you're doing well. I know you must be very busy.

Our editor, Dr. Elizabeth Rosenthal, is wondering whether the new coronavirus might be spreading through plumbing on the cruise ship? She sent me these links, below, about bow plumbing played a role in spreading SARS in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong . li.bby lived in China during the SARS outbreaks and remembers that the sinks there don't have the typical  U-bend  trap  that  sinks have here, which  allows sewer gases and unpleasant
odors to come through.

If plumbing is a risk for spreading coronavimses, what could be done to protect passengers on
cruise ships?

T'd love to hear your thoughts on this, even if just by email.


Thanks for yow- time.

The State Department and CDC travel alerts for China, which advise only absolutely essential travel, do not officiaUy include Hong Kong and so there is no official restriction right now (but this could change), and there is no quarantine requirement  upon  return ing from Hong Kong.    However, thi:s all could change quickly.	(b)(6)

Hi Dr. Fauci,


Below are draft responses to questions from a reporter with the Italian news agency ANSA. Please let me know if you have any suggested edits, and I'll move it along.

Thanks,
Kathy



Enrica Battifoglia
Science and Technology Head Editor ANSA news agency {Italian news) Enrica.Batt ifoglia@ansa.it
Expected place of publication: ANSA Science web page (www.ansa.it/sc ienza)



Dear Professor Fauci,

I am Enrica Battifoglia of the Italian news agency ANSA, I already have had the pleasure to
interview you several times at the AIDS world conferences.

I would like to ask you some questions about Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, to be published on the ANSA Science web page (www .ansa.it/sci enza), the main online science news resource in Italy with over l .5M contacts each month. I am sure that your clarity and competence will be highly valuable to put some much-needed  order among so many contrasting new s and data, and would be much  appreciated by  our readers.

1. Do the current available data allow to understand the threat level of coronavirus 2019- nCoV in terms of both lethality and diffusion speed, and about the possible evolution scenarios of the disease?

There is much that we do not know abou t the novel coronavirus. Currently, there have been more than 37,000 confirmed cases in China, and China has reported more than 800 deaths. As you know, there have been three confirmed cases in Italy to date. The reported case fatality rate (lethality) among the 37,000 cases that have come to the attention of the health care system is 2%.  However, given that there are likely many more cases that are without symptoms
or with minimal symptoms , the actual death rate is probably lower than 2%.

It is impossible to predict how the virus will evolve. It is our hope that the extraordinary containment measures that China has implemented will help prevent the outbreak from becoming a global pandem ic. But given that the virus is present in 27 countries to date and can
be transmitted from person-to-person, it may take a foothold and evolve into a global pandemic .





2) What exactly do we know about its modes of transmission, especially from people who
do not yet have the symptoms?

Again, there is much that we do not know about the novel coronavirus, including its specific transmission abilities. Based on initial findings that have been reported , we suspect its transmission is similar to influenza and other respiratory viruses, namely that is transm itted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and by touching surfaces, such as door handles, that recently have virus on them and then touching your face. There have also been reports that the virus is present in feces and vomit.  However, it is still uncertain that the virus can be transmitted through this route.

Traditionally, most viruses are transmitted when someone has symptoms. With the novel coronavirus; however, there appears to be asymptomatic transmission  occurring. We do not  know how many cases are being driven by asymptomatic transm ission or by those with symptoms. Typically, viruses are largely transmitted  by infected people experiencing symptoms.





3) Are the genetic sequences provided by China enough to start working on a vaccine?

The genetic sequ ences provided by China enabled researchers to quickly develop a diagnostic that is being used to determine whether someone is infected with the novel coronavirus. The genetic information has also been useful in work to develop a preventive vaccine. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pa.ii of the U.S. Nationa l Institu tes of Health, is
building on its experience with the SARS and MERS coronaviruses to better und erstand the virus as well as develop and test rapid point-of-care  diagnostics, vaccines and treatments, including broad-spectrum antivirals and antibody therapies. In terms of vaccines specifically, we are

working with the biotechnology  company Moderna and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) to develop a "messenger RNA" vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Other countries and companies are working to develop a vaccine as well.




4) What are the technical times to develop a working vaccine in terms of scientific research, and what are the approx times for the necessary legal certifications, and for industrial production and distribution?

In tern1s of our work with Moderna and CEPI to develop a vaccine , we anticipate having an experimental vaccine ready for Phase 1clinical trials within 2 to 3 months. This Phase l clinical trial will involve administering the vaccine to a small number of healthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and has some ability to induce an immune response . Ifthat is successful and the outbreak has not ended, we will move to a larger Phase 2 clinical trial with the expectation of proving the efficacy (or not) of the vaccine within 1to1.5 years.  U efficacious, it will still take additional months to produce enough vaccine to distribute widely ..

In addition to this vaccine, NIAID is also supporting scientists and companies to develop other vaccine candidates.




5) 2019-nCov is the third Coronavirus aggressive for humans that bas appeared in the East in the last 20 years and in 2009 the virus responsible for the flu pandemic too did come from China: what sort of preventive measures could be practicable to reduce the risk of repetition of these events?

To clarify, the 2009 HlNl influenza virus was first reported in Mexico, not China.


Viruses affecting humans have occurred throughout history, from the Bubonic Plague to the 1918 flu. We cannot predict what emerging infectious diseases will occur nor prevent the unknown from occurring in the first place. What we can do is learn as much as we can about emerging viruses, so that we can rapidly develop safe and effective point-of-care diagnostics, treatments and vaccines to protect against infection.

Subject: Cowen Health Care Conference in Boston - China Pharma Market Panel - March 2, 2020 in
Boston


Hi Dr. Fauci


I am a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Cowen and Company, a New York City based investment company that specializes in health care. Each year we host a Health Care Conference in Boston in March that attracts 200+ companies and 1000+ investors.  During this year's conference, we had planned to host a one-hour panel discussion on the evolution of and reforms within the China Health Care System and China Pharmaceutical market. However, given global concerns around Coronavirus, we have decided to focus the panel instead on the virus and the outlook for emerging treatments.  This perspective is critical to health care companies and therefore the institutions that invest in them.

Our panel will take place during Cowen's 40th Annual Health Care Conference, which will be held at the Marriott Copley Place in Boston on March 2-4, 2020. We plan to host this panel on
Monday morning, March 2nd, between 9:05-lO:OSAM. Attendees at our conference include institutional investors from insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and other types of funds, mainly in the U.S. and EU.

Cowen would provide you an honorarium for your time during the one-hour panel. We propose an honorarium of $1,500, and we reimburse conference-related travel expenses.

The discussion will be Q&A only and no presentation on your part is requested. We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely, Steve Scala

Ithas been many years since we corresponded regarding smallpox bioterro1ism and vaccination contTOI.

   The attached paper on containing a commun ity coronavirus outbreak from a few initial cases via isolation and quarantine mighL interest you. The news is mosLly good - isolation and quarantine can ge1 the Lransmissioo rate below  epidemic  tl1reshold  - but  the  key  is rapid  detection of infected  persons.  Also discussed  are some  ideas  for alleviating congestion  in  the  hospital.    [ hope that you find  it  helpful.

Janet.:
Nothi11g definite on this.  To my knowledge, uo one has specifically looked at real cross-reactivity although there
have been speculation that because there is about 80-90% homology between nCoV and SARS that there may be some use of the rn.Abs made against SARS for nCoV.  I have not seen auy data where people took sera from patients with nCo V and checked if it neutralized SARS and vice versa.

Good morning.


I'd like to follow up on yesterday's inquiry from our reporter Neal.


If Dr. Fauci is available to address the concerns of this cruise ship in Japan with Corona virus (re: air circulation system) today, we'd love him to have him on.

Unfortuna tely, the first available interview time is after 11a .m.


If it works,please let me know. This time, we'd like to record an interview to be used for air so we have some flexibility.

Thank you !

Hi, Dr. Fauci. Hope you're well




Spoke with some passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, where the number of coronavirus cases onboard are jumping. Can we do a brief interview re: thoughts on quarantining on board ship (with,   would assume a closed circulating air system) versus evacuating them?




I'm available at your earliest convenience. Or, if you'd like to just email some thoughts, that'd be great. Thanks and best.

Go to CDC website.	There are no travel alerts for Singapore and so for now it is
OK to travel there.

Hello Dr Fauci,
By way of introduction , Twas Jim MacLowry's last fellow at the NIB and have been working in the UK since then as a medical microbiologist and hospital epidemiologist.
I am the lead medical microbiologist al' the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK and was wondering about your availability please to speak at a conference on emergent Coronavirus threats to be held at the RSM on November 24th coming?
The RSM is a unique educational cba1ity here and we have councils covering all aspects of healthcare. The program is still developing but Iwanted to check on your availability quickly- we have an academic fond to which Ican
apply to cover your trip but will need to do so soon.
Jt was both exciting and inspirational being a senior staff fellow at the NIH - my background is international;
-....,-----------...,--..,,..------,-_,,.....,.,...-----,.---,--c----  and  the   international   perspectives
at the NIH were so encouraging. All non- American fellows recognised the nationa l strategic remit of the N1H for
the US , but I have often wondered if an assessment has ever been made of how fellows like myself have brought the
spirit of that institution to other nations.
With kind regards,
lan

Hi Or . Fauci,
I'm filling in for Molly Walker on the coronavirus beat while she's covering a meeting for MedPage Today, but I wanted to see if you could were available to offer your quick reaction to the Supplementary Index published today (attached) in the New England Journal of Medicine regarding the widely reported asymptomatic contact in Germany.

Looking at the patient's daily take on how she felt it's unclear to me whether this qualifies as
symptomatic or not.Iimagine this will be disputed.
Best regards,

Subject: BuzzFeed News: 2019-nCoV vaccine development questions Dr. Fauci,
As you may recall, I'm a science reporter at BuzzFeed News. We wonder if you might have any perspective (or might recommend someone to comment) for a novel coronavirus story we are writing for this weekend, regarding vaccine efforts.

In short, we wonder how you see an eventual vaccine playing a role in the future of the outbreak? CDC has described the virus as not mutating as much as influenza -- does that suggest a vaccine would provide more than seasonal protection?

In the long term, we had a few other questions. Is this something you could see added to the MMR protocol for the general public, or only in regions where there are local outbreaks (is there an analogy to SARS or MERS vaccines in this contemplated use)? Is there any aspect of a race against time in vaccine development if this coronavirus is seasonal like influenza?

We are basically trying to understand where a vaccine fits into the future response to this new virus. we asked you these sort of questions about the Zika vaccine efforts and your perspective really helped a lot. Apologies for all the questions, if you had any perspective, we'd be grateful

HiTony,
I know you must be swamped by matters related to the coronavirus. Nonetheless, I'd really like to confer, even if briefly. Would you have any window by phone today, over the weekend or next week? I'll also call Kirn Barasch, per your recent guidance.

I'm researching an article that will chiefly explore the status of the Defense Department's advanced development and manufacturing facility in Alachua, Florida. On a related note, I'm also curious re the three HHS/BARDA facilities.

I hope this email finds you well! My name is Amanda Morris and I'm a bioscience reporter at the Arizona
Republic, part of the USA Today network. I'm reaching out because I'm currently working on a story about how some ASU researchers (Brenda Hogue, Bert Jacobs and Shawn Chen) are trying to develop strategies to make a vaccine against the new coronavirus as well as a general platform they can use in the case offuture new coronavirus strain outbreaks in humans.

I know globally there are many researchers trying to develop a vaccine for this new coronavirus, and that the NIH is working with Moderna to do so -and hopes to start testing with in a few months. I'm wondering if Ican talk to you over the phone and ask a few questions about the work that NIH is doing, and what the broader challenges are for developing a vaccine? I'd like to have broader context about vaccines for our readers.
Please let me know as soon as possible. You can call or text me at -----Thank you!

At least a dozen drngmakers are worki ng on vaccines or antivira ls to help those infected with the fast-spreading virus that has killed more than 500 people in China, but several have warned that development of treatments will take time.

"We have seen a flurry of activities from other companies," CEO Paul Hudson told a news
conference after Sanofi published 2019 results on Thursday.


"We are one of the few companies that bas the expertise to know when it is just a fantasy, or when it could be real. In the next week or two, you will see something more confinnatory about the approach we will take."


Hudson declined to give further details.


Sanofi had already said it was sharing its expertise and data acquired from other outbreaks with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is working with biotech businesses to try to develop a vaccine candidate for the coronavirus.


Britain's GlaxoSmithKline is also collaborating with CEPI.


"The objective here is not a newspaper headline, it is real work that will make a difference," Hudson said.

Greetings from Uganda and indeed Africa. It was pleasure meeting you at the Grand Challenges Meeting in Ethiopia late last year. While there you, Francis Collins and I among others discussed the CARI   Initiative and the need to support research, entrepreneurship and innovation in a big way in Africa.  We also explored the mechanism for CARI Funding. We were also looking for a mechanism to reach the Committee of Ten (ClO) Heads of State and Government championing Education, Science and Technology in Africa.

Well allow me to inform you that on 13th Dec 2019, Iwas elected to chair for 2 years the Ministers of Education and of Science and Technology in all the SS Members States in Africa. We do this under the Specialized Technical Committee on Education, Science and Technology {STC-EST). This Saturday on 8th Feb in Addis, as chair of the ST -EST Iwill attend and speak at the Meeting of the above-mentioned ClO.

The purpose of this message is to let you know of my added responsibilities and related opportunities as well as seek for any update or latest information regarding the CARI initiative. I look forward to intensified communication and collaboration.

Regards

Good morning Tony.
Given your most recent appointment, I wanted to show
you the courtesy of letting you know what I have already provided to senior leaders at the White House regarding a possible mitigating strategy until the definitive solution to the CoV is available and implemented. The string below includes additional information as to how titanium dioxide can fit into both the White House and the
National / International solutions, and the open-source website for the company.	Please keep in mind that because this product is already approved and in use in the
EU for a variety of commercial uses, the data provided
does not specifically address the applications I, and you, are interested in. Ho\ivever, with a deep understanding of the White House mission, I can say that there is not a big leap in that thought migration.


Dr. Jackson has already provided the same material to some of your White House Commission colleagues. I will also be reaching out to another friend of mine from the Bush-now-Trump Adininistration,  Steve Biegun.


I encourage your representatives to meet with the
company leadership and scientists while they are in the US
next week.	Please let me know if you have any questions
that Ican address. Thank you for once again stepping up
to the plate for our Country.

Good morning Gentlemen,
Ijust spoke with Ronny and believe Ineed to offer A relevant update and one point of explanation. First, the company's joint venture partner in India is meeting w ith the Indian government as we speak.
It appears likely that in light of the news of India's introduction to the corona virus the government will utilize their "NationalCatastrophe Budget" to expedite the funding necessary to secure and execute a contract with this company.

Secondly, Iwill attach the open source web site for the company to provide you background information
that, out of respect for your time and for the sake of brevity, Ileft out of yesterday's note. It's important to note a couple of things:
This product is already proved and is in use in the EU with all the approvals appropriate for the same. Secondly, in our language, this is a "standoff productr'' -I.e. you apply it once and it continues to
decontaminate and disinfect in the background for up to 1-5 years before retreating. (Depending on the
type of use, normal daily cleaning using their cleaning solution-that is cheaper and more effective than what the application normally would use, e.g. in a hotel-continues). The chemical treats anything organic, I.e. bacteria, viruses, VOC, bio threats,etc. because it is a catalyst, it is neither used up, nor

does it produce microbial resistance or superbugs. It decontaminates and disinfects surfaces (e,g, airplanes and government critical infrastructures) and the air around the surface (and HVAC filters and air handlers).

The leadership will be in DC next week. Ihighly encourage any and all potential stakeholders make time to meet with them while they are here. To that end, Ihad already emailed Dr. Fauci (with whom I worked a great deal on similar chalenges during the Bush Administration) before the announcement of his participation on the new coronavirus commission, Iwill also reach out to an old friend and colleague Steve BIEGUN now that he is in the commission . Please feel free to forward the information to others as you deem appropriate.

Thanks,

Gentlemen, Brothers,	and Others...


This is Dick Tubb, writing on behalf of Admiral Jackson and Dr. Hofmann (both copied herein).  It feels like "old times"--I'm undecided as to whether they are good old times, or otherwise.  Regardless, it does feel like we've been down a very similar road before.	Perhaps we can apply some of the lessons-learned to the inevitable problems ahead.

In light of the current and evolving threat presented by the corona virus, I am writing to you as a courtesy to inform you of a project that Admiral Jackson, Dr. Hofmann, and I have been consulting on. We believe so strongly in the technology, people, and potential that we have been consulting pro bono and currently have no financial stake in the project. While not developed specifically designed for such purposes, I increasingly believe that until a vaccination and treatment for the corona virus is available, this technology may be the last best chance in containing, and eradicating the virus, thereby protecting
the homeland, our economy, the Continuity of the Presidency, an Enduring Constitutional Government, our people and our Country. Moreover, reverting to my "lessons-learned, problems-ahead" statement, even after this crisis is over, and a vaccine and treatment procured, it will only be a matter of time until "next time." This letter is proof-positive of that reality. My experiences, especially in the early 2ooo's (e.g. anthrax and other biothreats, SARs, etc.) underpin my beliefs.


The technology that provides the solution, both now and in the future, involves a unique formulation of a photo catalytic

nano titanium dioxide solution (the Air Force guys will, of course, understand what that means, so you non-Air Force folks, just buy them a beer and they'll explain it to you) that is safer, more effective, and more cost effective than any other solution. It was developed and approved in the EU, and I have asked the senior leadership of the company to come to Washington DC next week. Dr. Hofmann and I spent the day yesterday with a Chinese "titan" respected by and with access to the most senior government officials, academic and medical giants, and investment and industry captains. I have encouraged, and he has agreed in principal, to follow our recommendations as they relate to their largest airline, and their key facilities.


In short, our strategic priority is to first fortify the weak link in the pandemic chain: the airlines. Doing so will provide the time necessary to isolate, contain, and ultimately destroy the threat at its source
(Wuhan),and in its home (China). As
President Bush so commonly stated about a very different threat, we need to fight the
battle over there, so that we don't have to fight the battle here. Although President Bush was a true believer in the threat of a
pandemic, I believe this threat, and the

threats that are surely to follow are, in reality, many, many times greater than the threat he envisioned when making that statement.  By fighting a possible impending pandemic at its source we will preserve and protect the safety and confidence of our people, and the strength of our economy.


Once we have interrupted the threat supply chain, we can then shore up our critical infrastructure using the same technology and process, then assist the Chinese in addressing their challenges, and protect
our international allies elsewhere. In that
vein, in addition to the Chinese, I have also discussed this technology and strategy with senior proxies for another of my former patients, His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and his father, the King.


As I noted above, I have asked the leadership of the company to come to Washington (from Germany and Denmark) next week for a variety of meetings. While Admiral Jackson will be "tied up in Texas" for the foreseeable future, please let me know if you would like to meet with myself or Dr. Hofmann, or the company

leadership while they are here, to learn more.


Thank you and my best to you all as you plan for and continue to protect our Country,


Very Respectfully,


Dick Tubb

China: More than 2,800 Cases of 2019-nCoV in 30 Provinces/Municipalities , Mainly in Wuhan ; Cases Exported to 16 Countries

WHAT'S NEW

According to regional health authorities, more than 1,800 additional , confirmed cases (including 25 deaths) of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported since January 27, 2020, throughout the country, mainly in the provinces of Hubei (1,291), Guangdong (207), Zhejiang (173), Henan (168), and Hunan (143) and in the cities of Chongqing (132), Beijing (19), and Shanghai (13). Most new cases had a travel history to Wuhan. Almost all the recent deaths occurred in Hubei Province. Twenty more patients have recovered and been

discharged. More than 4,600 confirmed cases (including> 100 deaths) have occurred since December 8, 2019.

A total of 13 additional,exported, confirmed cases have been reported (through January 28, 2:00 p.m. EST) since Monday, January 27. More than 25 cases have been exported in the past 7 days. Cases reported since Monday arrived in the following countries on the dates shown: Singapore (January 19 and 23), Taiwan (January 22), Japan (January 20 and 21), France (arrival date unknown), and Thailand (arrival dates unknown). All of these cases had travel history to Wuhan or contact with an ill person from Wuhan while in China.

In addition to these exported cases, 7 locally acquired cases have been reported since Monday in Germany (4), Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. The cases in Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam reported contact with an obviously ill person from China. In Germany all 4 cases had close contact in a
business seminar with an apparently asymptomatic Chinese woman on
January 21 (who previously had contact with relatives from Wuhan);the women states symptom onset was on a flight to Shanghai on January 23, and she was later confirmed to have 2019-nCoV. Incubation periods in these cases have been as short as 3 days. In light of the secondary cases in Germany in a business setting, the most cautious approach of having arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible exposure in China is increasingly justified.

Updated travel advisories include: 1) Australia: reconsider travel to China ;
2) Canada: avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 3) Finland: avoid nonessential travel to Hubei Province; 4) France: avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 5) Germany: avoid nonessential travel to China and avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 6) India: avoid all nonessential travel to China; 7) New Zealand: avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 8) Taiwan: avoid all nonessential travel to China.

Singapore now denies entry to residents of Hubei Province and those who have traveled there in the past 14 days.

Mongolia and 3 regions (Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, Yevreyskaya Oblast) in Far Eastern Federal District, Russia have closed their land borders with China.

Bangladesh, Canada, India, Kazakhstan , Russia, and South Korea are arranging flights to repatriate their respective citizens from Wuhan. These persons will be closely monitored and present little threat of onward transmission.

All tourist attractions in Tibet Autonomous Region have been closed.

Current influenza vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk of simple influenza being mistaken for 2019-nCoV upon return.

Infection control supplies have been depleted in medical facilities in the smaller cities in central China ; the situation is critical in many areas and resupply is uncertain.

OVERALL  RISK ASSESSMENT

The epidemic in China is months from peaking . A report indicates that just prior to the cordoning off of Wuhan, over 5 million residents (many potentially infectious) left for other parts of China , and many thousands left for Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan . Exported cases have so far been to countries likely to be capable of controlling (but not preventing) ongoing transmission , which will inevitably occur. In light of the secondary cases in Germany in a business setting , the most cautious approach of having arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible exposure in China is increasingly justified.

Based on increasing data on virology , clinical presentation, and transmission, this coronavirus closely resembles SARS-CoV in many behaviors. Fortunately, sequential sequencing of viral isolates over time indicate no significant new viral mutations; mutations often increase transmission or virulence . WHO assesses the risk of this event to be very high in China , high at the regional level, and high at the global level. The closing of Wuhan airport and the major cities of Hubei province have yet to stem the flow of exported cases. The originally implicated animal market, now closed indefinitely, bears little relevance to the ongoing situation. Whether the market was the focus of a species jump from animals to humans or merely one of multiple amplification settings for initial cases is increasingly unclear . The degree of human-to-human spread outside of
Hubei province remains unclear. A reproductive number, Ro, is estimated at 1.4-2.5 by Chinese authorities and up to 5.5 by other scientists. An Ro greater than 1 indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent
case, making control much more difficult. The spectrum of disease
manifestations in a large cohort study has yet to be disclosed; a severe case rate of 20% has been consistent. The existence of mildly
symptomat ic and asymptomatic infectious cases could increase the risk of global spread. Case fatality is impossible to ascertain at present, and lesser or greater clinical virulence compared to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV remains speculative.

Current influenza vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk of simple influenza being mistaken for 2019-nCoV upon return.

Infection control supplies have been depleted in medical facilities in the smaller cities in central China ; the situation is critical in many areas and resupply is uncertain.

Overall Risk Assessment

The epidemic in China is months from peaking. A report indicates that just prior to the cordoning off of Wuhan, over 5 million residents (many potentially infectious) left for other parts of China, and many thousands left for Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. Exported cases have so far been to countries likely to be capable of controlling (but not preventing) ongoing transmission, which will inevitably occur. In light of the secondary cases in Germany in a business setting, the most cautious approach of having arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible exposure
in China is increasingly justified .

Based on increasing data on virology, clinical presentation, and transmission, this coronavirus closely resembles SARS-CoV in many behaviors. Fortunately, sequential sequencing of viral isolates over time indicates no significant new viral mutations; mutations often increase transmission or virulence. WHO assesses the risk of this event to be very high in China, high at the regional level, and high at the global level. The closing of Wuhan airport and the major cities of Hubei province have yet to stem the
flow of exported cases. The originally implicated animal market,now closed indefinitely , bears little relevance to the ongoing situation. Whether the market was the focus of a species jump from animals to humans or merely one of multiple amplification settings
for initial cases is increasingly unclear.The degree of human-to-human spread outside of Hubei province remains unclear. A reproductive number, Ro, is estimated at 1.4-
2.5 by Chinese authorities and up to 5.5 by other scientists .An Ro greater than 1 indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent case, making control much more difficult. The spectrum of disease manifestations in a large cohort study has yet to be disclosed; a severe case rate of 20% has been consistent. The existence of mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious cases could increase the risk of global spread. Case fatality is impossible to ascertain at present, and lesser or greater clinical virulence compared to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV remains speculative .

Current Disease Situation

More than 4,600 confirmed cases (976 severe and critical cases and 106 deaths) have occurred since December 8, 2019, in the provinces of Hubei (> 2,700; mainly in Wuhan), Guangdong (207), Zhejiang (173), Henan (168), Hunan (143), and Anhui
(106); in the cities of Chongqing (132), Beijing (91), and Shanghai (66);and in 21 other provinces throughout the country. An additional 6,900 suspected cases have been reported since January 21,2020. In the setting of a large outbreak and with increased delays in testing, a high proportion of suspected cases will evolve into confirmed cases. Seventy-nine cases have been discharged. Two-thirds of the cases are male. The youngest case is 10 years old and the oldest is 89; more than 70% of cases are over 40 years old,but the co-morbidity  profiles of most cases are unknown .

The number of persons becoming infected with the virus has been doubling every six days. The outbreak in China is not approaching peak, and modeling indicates that is months away.

Exported Cases

Seventy-seven imported cases of 2019-nCoV (confirmed after arrival) presented at international ports of entry January 6-25 in 16 countries. Of these cases, more than 25 cases arrived in the past 7 days.

In addition to these exported cases, 7 locally acquired cases have been reported since Monday in Germany (4), Japan, Taiwan , and Vietnam. The cases in Japan , Taiwan, and Vietnam reported contact with an obviously ill person from China. In Germany, all 4
cases had close contact in a business seminar with an apparently asymptomatic Chinese woman on January 21 {who previously had contact with relatives from Wuhan); the woman states symptom onset was on a flight to Shanghai on January 23, and she was later confirmed to have 2019-nCoV . Incubation periods in these cases have been as short as 3 days.

Entry/Exit Screening

In a reversal of long-standing policy, WHO now recommends that all countries implement temperature screening at points of entry for passengers arriving from 2019- nCoV-affected countries. Screening should be accompanied by dissemination of risk­ communication messages at points of entry to later capture asymptomatic persons who are in the incubation phase.

In early January, some exit screening was implemented at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (nonstop flights to Istanbul, London, New York, Osaka, Paris, Rome, San Francisco, Tokyo, and major hubs throughout Southeast Asia), as well as at 3 major rail stations in Wuhan. More restrictive screening was instituted on January 15 in Hubei
until cessation of international flights on January 23. Despite exit screening at all international airports in China in the past week, significant numbers of cases continue to be exported.

Entry screening at international ports of entry has been or is being implemented as noted below, and anyone with fever and respiratory symptoms who has been to 2019- nCoV-affected areas in the previous 14 days will be detained and isolated at these locations:

Transmission

The detailed epidemiology of possible causative animal exposures and zoonotic transmission remains unclear. Many (27 of 41) earlier cases were directly linked to South China Seafood City market in Jianghan District, which sold seafood and other wildlife (including birds). More than 580 environmental samples, without indication as to whether animal tissue was included, were collected from the implicated market. Of these, 33 tested positive for 2019-nCoV, indicating that the market was an-or the-origin point of the large-scale outbreak. Thirty-one of the positive samples (94%) were collected from the western part of the market, where wildlife was traded. The first published epi-curve shows that the symptom onset date of the first patient identified in the outbreak was December 1, 2019. The patient reported no exposure to the
implicated market; no epidemiological link has been detected between this case and
later cases. This finding raises the possibility of an initial jump of 2019-nCoV directly from bat to human, with subsequent initial human-to-human propagation within the seafood market.

Infected intermediate animal hosts, if they exist, may still be present in the supply chain. South China Seafood City market, now closed indefinitely, remained in operation through December 31, 2019. Other points of infection would be likely because many subsequent cases had no contact with the implicated market. Chinese authorities have now stated that human-to-human transmission is in the fourth generation in Wuhan and at least the second generation elsewhere (mostly in clusters). A reproductive number,
Ro, is estimated at 1.4-2.5by Chinese authorities and at up to 5.5 by some scientists. An Rogreater than 1 indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent case, making control much more difficult. Ro is not a constant number and changes with the
ongoing circumstances and evolution of an outbreak . One published cluster study
indicates asymptomatic shedding (but not transmission) by a single patient. Sequence data from several small clusters indicate identical virus in all subjects within the cluster.

More than 47 ,800 close contacts remain under surveillance(> 1,200 have been released), and contact tracing is ongoing in affected provinces and municipalities. However, not all contacts are being ascertained or monitored adequately. As many as 16 health care workers (HCWs) have been confirmed as infected by at least 1 case in Wuhan in a potential super-spreading event, but overall infectivity for HCWs has not been established . No case of 2019-nCoV has been attributed to transmission on an aircraft.

The survival rate of the virus on surfaces or in the environment is unknown . Disinfection processes that are effective for other zoonotic coronaviruses should be followed for now. Clean daily all "high-touch" surfaces , such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures , toilets, phones, keyboards, tables, and bedside tables. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, bodily fluids, and/or secretions or excretions on them. Use a diluted bleach solution or a household disinfectant with a label that says
"EPA-approved ." To make a bleach solution , add 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of bleach to 1 l
(1 quart) of water; for a larger supply, add 60 ml (2 oz) of bleach to 4 l(1 gallon) of water.

Clinical Manifestations

Most cases have reportedly exhibited symptoms of fever , respiratory compromise, and bilateral pneumonia with diffuse, ground glass-like infiltrates on chest x-ray or CT scan. Unlike SARS-CoV , upper respiratory illness symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing , sore throat) and diarrhea are not common. Overall, about 20% of the cases have been severe or critical, including pneumonia , respiratory failure, and in some cases death. The existence of asymptomatic cases has not been ascertained. No known treatment exists for 2019-nCoV , although remdesivir will be available shortly from the U.S. CDC for compassionate use. Usual antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu), baloxavir, ribavirin, and acyclovir, are ineffective. Steroids should not be used. Based on earlier literature,the combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir is under study in China. Current influenza vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk of simple influenza being mistaken for 2019-nCoV upon return.

In a small cohort of 41 patients (median age was 49 years; interquartile range: 41-58) conducted early in the epidemic (presentation before January 2), the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Dyspnea developed in 55% of patients at a median of 8 days. All cases except 1 had bilateral pneumonia. Milder cases had chest CTs that showed bilateral ground­ glass opacity with subsegmental areas of consolidation, whereas ICU patients had bilateral lobar and subsegmental areas of consolidation. Only 66% of cases (even in
this early cohort) had been exposed to the South China Seafood City market. The case­
fatality rate was estimated to be 15%, but more severe cases tend to predominate early in an epidemic . Limited data from another published cluster study indicate a 3- to 6-day incubation period similar to SARS-CoV and clinical and radiologic features similar to SARS-CoV cases in 2003. Another report indicates an incubation period ranging from 1 to 14 days.

Virology

2019-nCoV was initially isolated from 1 case and entirely sequenced ; this information was published internationally by Chinese scientists on January 10. Electron microscopy of 1 specimen demonstrated classic coronavirus particles. 2019-nCoV is the seventh

member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Novel coronaviruses from Wuhan, together with 2 bat-derived SARS-like strains, form a distinct clade in lineage B of the subgenus sarbecovirus. 2019-nCov is a group 2b coronavirus (as are MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV), with a whole genome similarity of up to 80% to SARS-CoV but with a similarity between different gene segments ranging from 60% to 90%. 2019-nCoV exhibits a 96.5% similarity to the known bat coronavirus precursors in the same viral clade.

Sequence data allowed national laboratories to rapidly develop diagnostic kits, which are now available in most developed countries and most Asian countries. HKU1, NL63, 229E,and OC43 are human coronaviruses that are detected by some routine multiplex PCR panels used in routine clinical practice. These coronaviruses are associated with minor upper respiratory infections and viral pneumonia, but unlike SARS-CoV, MERS­ CoV, and 2019-nCoV , these agents are not associated with major outbreaks or severe respiratory distress syndrome. 2019-nCoV is not reactive in these tests. The findings so far strongly favor (but do not prove) causation. 2019-nCoV has been shown to use the same cell-entry receptor as SARS-CoV. Viral loads appear to be highest in lower respiratory tract specimens, which should be the primary specimen obtained. Prediction of human-to-human transmissibility from sequence data is difficult because coronaviruses vary widely in their transmissibility; coronaviruses acquired from animals generally have some potential for human-to-human transmission. Evidence from subsequent whole genome sequences acquired over the last several weeks show little genetic variation, indicating that the virus jumped from an animal reservoir to humans within the last few months . Identical recent mutations in epidemiologically unlinked cases support sustained human-to-human transmission .

Criteria for Testing of Suspected Cases


U.S. CDC

Persons meeting the following criteria (clinical features and epidemiologic risk) for suspected cases of 2019-nCoV will be considered persons under investigation (PUI):
 Fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of
breath) plus a history of travel to Wuhan or close contact with a PUI for 2019-nCoV while that person was ill in the past 14 days before symptom onset
 Fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of
breath) plus close contact with an ill, laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV case in the past 14 days before symptom onset

HCWs entering the room with a PUI should use standard precautions, contact precautions , airborne precautions ,and eye protection (e.g.,goggles or a face shield).

PUis for 2019-nCoV should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed , ideally an airborne­ infection isolation room if available.

Prevention

Travelers going to Wuhan should avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat), and contact with ill­ appearing persons. Quality of infection control at medical facilities in Wuhan is uncertain,and those with minor medical problems should avoid busy medical settings.

Infection control supplies have been depleted in medical facilities in the smaller cities in central China; the situation is critical in many areas and resupply is uncertain.Travelers who develop fever and respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to Wuhan should immediately be isolated, and public health authorities should be alerted.

Employees , Students , Visitors , All Others Coming from Wuhan

Whether asymptomatic individuals infected with 2019-nCoV are infectious to others is unknown. Influenza viruses can be transmitted 1to 2 days prior to symptom onset. SARS-CoV did not transmit until 4 days after symptom onset , which led to its eradication because all contacts with fever could be promptly identified and isolated.

If 2019-nCoV is similar to SARS-CoV, asymptomatic arrivals from Wuhan should self­ monitor by taking a temperature reading immediately prior to coming into the workplace or school for 14 days after their last exposure in Wuhan. Arrivals with fever at any time should self-report to public health authorities (or telephone ahead before presenting to a hospital) and should wear a mask as soon as possible. A more stringent approach would require that an employee, student, or visitor-upon arrival to a workplace or school-be instructed to perform an additional temperature check in the presence of medical personnel to ensure compliance with local self-monitoring requirements. In addition, prior to any gathering of 2 persons, attendees could be required to perform additional self-monitoring .

Based on advanced information and employee or visitor medical screening, additional preventive measures may be required (e.g., increased ventilation, larger meeting rooms with more personal space per participant , disinfection of work areas and lavatories, and provision of alcohol wipes).

The most cautious approach would be for arrivals to stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible exposure in China. To date, all known cases exported to other countries had either visited Wuhan or had contact with an ill person from Wuhan while in China.

The author of our case-series - proof today will send to you - is an ICU doc in Wuhan - trained with Derek Angus - he has been great - butIhave asked him about bimselt: llis family - we loss track of the personal - which is so important.

lhave had a few "emergencies" like this - at BCH - with Jerry Klein - some infectious disease outbreaks; a couple major car accidents; etc. Also worked at the Berhorst Clinic in Guatemala in 1978 (before there was global health) numerous 5-10-15 people emergencies - always end though - for you this is the pandemic that never stops giving.

Try to take a break; have a good glass of Claret on me.

Likely come up tomorrow in our discussion - not NEJM paper but just the concept. Outline if OK with you


What's up in China

What's up around the world

\.Vhat's up in US

And then more specific questions

Is this more like HlNI than MERS

Can we really know  morta lity risk (denominator problem).

The paper was flawed,  Embarrassment for NEJM .  However, the concept is correct.  Spoke in detail to the
Director of the Chinese CDC (confidential) and they are seeing asymptomatic transmission (low level) in China.

Hi Tony and Hugh.

I know that I am writing to you at a busy time during yet another infectious disease outbreak that is rapidly evolving. However, I wanted to send you a brief note to update you about the transformational change going on in the landscape of our free standing institute with its new, sharply defined goal to be the global leader in eradicating infectious disease threats in the world . I know that you are familiar with us.

I have been leading the institute since June of 2017 and currently finishing year one of a 10 year board-approved plan of growth in our scientists , educationa l programming and campus modernization. I believe that you are aware that we house the only private BSL4.We also just opened our newest of 5 BSL3 facilities . this newest one being nearly 8000 sq. ft. with capacity for -100 NHPs, small animals, a complete aerosol suite and a PET CT.We also house the SNPRC, now under the leadership of Deepak Kaushal
(who replaced Robert Lanford) and with the largest marmoset colony as a result of restructuring our building facilities (in addition to our other species .	CbH4J











Please check out our newly designed website: www .txbiomed.ora .

The bottom line is that I left university life to lead an organization that is determined to not only discover critical, new fundamental science but also effectively and efficiently bring it full forward to create portfolios for the FDA through our business model, nimbleness, regulated science culture (GLP level), longstanding public and private partners through contract science (esp. BARDA), culture and community support.

We want to help! Please let us know if and how we can contribute to this outbreak and undoubtedly others going forward .

I truly appreciate your leadership. The country gets the voice of reason on infectious disease outbreaks through your public efforts. I enjoyed learning more about this during my time on council.

Best,

Larry

Subject: Potential Approach to Wuha

Dear Dr. Fauci ,
You I ikely do not recall meeting me when J was looking at potential fellowships in 1978, however,   never forgot
your enthusiasm.Iwent out to San Diego and worked with Mike Oldstone, between 1979 and 1984.
J did smdy a mouse coronavirus while there, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). I focused on genetic resistance, and
eventually described a mouse locus for suscepLibility, which coded for the MHV receptor.
Lacking the correct receptor or blocking binding of the virus spike protein to the receptor with monoclonal
antibodies blocked infection.
On to the present problem  of human coronaviruses. Vaccines will take a long time for the current crisis. The angi.otensin converting enzyme 2 receptor has been identified as the relevant  human coronavirus receptor  in earlier studies of SARS and MERS human coronavirns outbreaks. lam writing to suggest the investigation of ARBs as potential blocking agents to eitber reduce or completely block infection. Perhaps this can be checked . if conect, there may still be sufficient untainted supplies of ARBs, such as irbesartan. available, or productio n can be scaled up, if this truly is the eve of a pandemic.
Wishing you success in this endeavor.Iam willing to contribute in any way lcan. Please feel free to contact me by
e-mail or my eel Iphone.
T also did do clinical trials whi le with Mike, and then when I joined  the neurology faculty ofJefferson in
Phi ladelphia. J have been out on my own since December 1998, but J have never lost my interest in this work. For another time, Ialso have some novel ideas on how HIV becomes AIDS, as well. I ronically , these ideas were based upon observations T made during my analysis of MHV .
All the Best,
Robert L Knobler, MD, PhD

Subject: Dr. Levitt summarizes CDC 2019-nCoV Committee Report released today 5 Feb 2020 Dear Secretary Azar  and Dr. Fauci,
I have read carefully the CDC's report issued this morning on the Wuhan virus {2019-nCoV) epidemic originating in Wuhan, Hubei Province, PRC. The Report was prepared by CDC's best Ph.D.s, M.D.s, and D.V.M.s See the pdf attached above for the complete report.

Below Ihave recorded what I think the most important facts in the report for Secretary Azar and other federal officials who must stop the spread of 2019-nCoV in the U.S. by identifying all infected persons and their contacts. I have also added my personal thoughts on how to stop the spread of this novel coronavirus and a personal fear I have communicated to Secretary Azar in the past:

--  President Trump signed an order preventing entry into the U.S. of any person who has traveled to mainland China (PRC). Exceptions include U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their fa milies. Thank you Mr. Trump.

-- CDC maintains an office in the PRC. So information from Wuhan, Hubei, PRC, should be 'real
time'.


-- Enhanced screening of persons entering the U.S. is taking place at 18 ports and 5 airports. The number of ports and especially airports needs to be increased. The Report states that 14,000 Chinese enter the U.S.daily . If the S airports receive 85% of these Chinese, then 2,100 Chinese enter the U.S. daily at other airports without enhanced screening.

-- CDC has developed its own RT-PCR test to detect 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens . Ihave read case reports where state laboratories have required too much proof of suspected Wuhan virus from clinicians before performing RT-PCR testing of specimens. CDC should provide their improved RT-PCR test to all states and HHS should insure that all states have sufficient equipment and trained personnel for  rapid turn-around  time.


-- CDC has grown the 2019-nCoV virus. CDC should expedite distribution of the grown virus to researchers with verified credent ials and vetting in a safe and monitored procedure.

-- CDC recommends that persons suspected by clinicians of having 2019-nCoV be placed in a separate room with a N95 face mask so that they are not in range of other patients. HCW should wear personal protection :gloves, gown,face shield or N95 mask and goggles.


-- Clinicians have identified 8 of the current 11patients infected with 2019-nCoV in the U.S.
CDC is doing a terrific job in getting the message out to clinicians and the public.

  Thanks for the note.  It likely will be more efficient if I refer you to the program people in my Institute who could go over these data with you and then get me involved later.  The reason that is that I am doing 18 hours pe day  (seriously) as part of the White House Task Force and it would very difficult for me to fit in a meeting to go over data.

Couple of things:


 Ispoke again with WHO this morning. I believe they have listened and acted. Let me know if
you agree
o At the WHO meeting next week they will set up the Group who will "look at the origins and evolution of 2019n-CoV"
o They have asked for names to sit on that Group - please do send any names

o We can have a call this week with a core group of that to frame the work of the Group
including - if you could join?
o Ithink this puts it under the umbrella of WHO, with action this week and into next
o With names to be put forward into the Group from us and pressure on this group from your and our teams next week.
 The team will update the draft today and Iwill forward immediate ly -they will add further comments on the glycans

Does that sound reasonable to you?

Greetings Patty and Tony -- Isee you on TV constantly guiding us through the terrain on our preparedness for outbreaks such as what we have seen in China . Iwant to see if Ican add one more request to your pile to think about ....and I am trying to see if what I am suggesting might work right before your Aspen talk next Tuesday at noon.

In addit ion to my great role at The Hill, Iam host of a new show called "The Bottom Line" on Al Jazeera English that runs four times a week on their global network and is garnering between 100k-200k views a week on YouTube in the US. The show is doing really well and is a 24 minute panel discussion of three experts on a single topic that I facilitate.  Iwould love to have you, Tony, be the anchor commentator on what we should do not only on the coronavirus but in general on the infrastructure of pandemic preparedness in the country-- sort of a shorter form of that great PBS show you did called Invisible Killers.

We would want to tape in our studio at 21st and M Streets NW from 11:00 am - 11:30 am (we don't go over), or Icould move it 15 to 30 minutes earlier if you like next Tuesday, 11February. I know you have to be at Aspen at noon (I was invited too) -- so I could take you if you like.

I realize that this may be too much. -- but in these times, Ithink it's important to get smart commentary and analysis out there -- and Ithink Ican add a couple hundred thousand eyeballs and ears to the millions you are already reaching. The producers are also able to provide car and driver	(b  (4)

Subject:Interview request by BBC Chinese


Dear Dr Anthony 5 Fauci,


This is Zacha ry from BBC Chinese.


Iam now writing a piece regarding the treatment of people in isolation or quarantine over coronavirus
in different countries .


Most of the countries told the public where the people evacuated from Wuhan reside for qua ra ntine and some drew local's protests.They expressed concern over close vicinity and some even went to protest in these places.
Others like Taiwan, the authority decided to keep the quarantine location confidential. The reason is to
avoid unnecessary worr isome and let people rest wel l.


Iwould like to have an interview with you by e-mail or Skype phone with you to give some insights or comments on this issue.

If you could be quoted, the questions are as below


1. Why does the government tell the public the quarantine location? Is it necessary? Or why not?


2. Many residents protested because they don't want the quarantine Center for Coronavirus in their neighborhood.Do they need to worry about it?

3. What is your suggestion regarding the location of quarantine those people from Wuhan. And what is essential for Quarantine Center for Coronavirus?

Thank you very much for your time. Zachary Lee
BBC Chinese

Hi,


Dept. of Energy is looking for $99.5 million. They are concerned that NIH will use their super compute rs for coronavirus (which NIH doesn't pay for) and displace paying customers.  What is the expectation that NIH will need to use DOE super computers? We wo uld include additional funds (please make sure TF knows Iwould not take his funds and give to DOE), but this seems extreme ly high to me and Iwa s trying to understand the need from your perspective for these super computers.  Happy to jump on the phone if that is easier, but need this as fast as you can get it to me please- within the next hour or so. Language is below. Thank you!

RE: NAS




Nancy:
  The official USG group will be convened by NAS. Bob Kadlec is the person with direct knowledge of that.	In addition, there is an ad hoc group informally led by Jeremy Farrar of Wellcome Trust . This group has about 15 people, all of whom are highly respected scientists, mostly evolutionary biologists who are convening by e-mail and conference calls (I have been on 2 of these calls since Jeremy invited me) to look at all of the bat, pangolin and human coronavirus sequences
to try and determine the evolutionary origin.  This is not my area of expertise and
so I have backed off and am leaving it all to Jeremy .
Best, Tony

Hi,Patrick -
We've put this in motion - once it's cleared thru CDC, we wi ll send back to this group so NIH com ms can move thru with their editing/revisions .

Let me know if that sounds OK. We will likely not have a cleared version out of CDC until late Saturday at the earliest.
Take care,

CDC and NIH folks,


Per some discussion after the presser, we'd like Dr. Redfield and Dr. Fauci to pen an op-ed regarding the reasons/thinking behind the policy announced today. Iassume the right building blocks for it would be the remarks they made today- which Ibelieve you all should have the copy/notes for? Ihave the Secretary's, which we'll be sending around/posting shortly and I'll make sure to re-up it here so you all have it.

It would be great to have a draft of this cleared to get to the WH over the weekend. (I anticipate faster­ than-average clearance from them!)

Please let me know how Ican help with this.


Best,
Patrick

Subject: Following Up If We can Be of Any Assistance



Dear Dr. Suzuki -






Lamana,


I hope this finds you Igood health and expect that you are deeply involved in the events of coronavirus in your region. I understand from various communications with the MHLW that is considering ending the quarantine early and releasing passengers from the Diamond Princess, especially those who are 80 years of age or older. Given the media reports and public perception there is pressure to do this. However, as medical experts, you and I both know that days 3 - 8 are within the normal incubation period and these new positives do not likely represent shipboard transmission. As such, HHS is willing to coordinate U.S. medical experts who can engage with English language media explaining and reassuring the passengers, crew, and public.



Regarding support for the quarantine, ASPR is ready to deploy a team of 3-5 people quickly, and as many 12 people to Japan to support as suggested in the previous call. If we can assist you
and your team in managing the Americans currently in quarantine please let me know. If there is other support do let me know and ASPR will work to assist. As we've talked for the past 18 months about such a scenario, this may not be the one we envisioned, but it is a perfect case as we can clearly identify the Americans, they are in a contained area.  Our mutual efforts and planning have paid unexpected dividends .



I am available to discuss via teleconference at your convenience. I am grateful for all MHLW
has done to support this complicated response on top of your work supporting repatriation and domestic monitoring of your own citizens. We are grateful for Dr. Sugihara's herculean information sharing efforts and the rest of your MHLW team support during this event; it

validates of the importance of our ongoing liaison program and the long term benefits of our mutual commitment to each other's public health security

Please remain well and I look forward to see you again soon.


Best wishes and warm regards.


Dr Bob Kadlec
ASPR

We have three people on the way to Beijing who will work with our Chinese counterparts on finalizing
the TOR and composition of the joint WHO - China mission.As you are much aware, the US has given us a number of names who will be able and willing to join such a mission. We have received similar proposals from other countries and will now match the "long list" of experts with the required specific expertise.

We are hoping to have more clarity over the coming days and will obviously keep you in the loop. The overall number will be kept at a level to make sure that the team is fully operational.

UPDATE 1-WHO advance team on coronavirus on way to China - Tedros tweet
Stephani e Nebehay
By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - An advance team of international experts led by the World Health Organization {WHO) has left for Beijing to help investigate China's coronavirus epidemic,the Geneva-based agency said on Sunday .
WHO director-general Tedros Adha nom Ghebreyesus,who made a trip to Beijing for talks with President Xi Jinping and Chinese ministers in late January,returned with an agreement on sending an international mission.
But it has taken nearly two weeks to get the government 's green light on its composition, which was not announced, other than to say that WHO veteran Dr. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiolog ist and emergencies expert, was heading it.
"I've just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led
#2019nCoV international expert mission to #China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies ," Tedros said in a tweet from Geneva.
Dr. Sylvie Briand, who accompanied Tedros last month and stayed behind for talks with top Chinese health officials, told Reuters last week that they were discussing a list of experts with China.
"Because it is a joint mission, they need to be on board, it's not just an international group going there. We have about 15 people," said Briand, director of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness at WHO.
China raised the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak to 811 on Sunday, passing the number killed globally by the SARS epidemic,as authorities made plans for millions of people returning to work after an extended Lunar New Year break.
The virus,which has spread to two dozen countries,has killed some 2% of more than
37,550 cases worldwide, with 99 percent of infections in China,WHO figures show.
The WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency on Jan. 30,days after the Chinese central government imposed a lockdown on 60 million people in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, epicentre of the virus that emerged in December in a seafood market.

Tedros said on Saturday that he hoped the team would include experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
"It has to be meaningful on the ground," Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown Law, said in an interview in Geneva this week.
Gostin called for a "genuine partnership with transparent flows of information and accountability for the response", adding that there should be a strong CDC presence. "CDC has got no peer in terms of its experience and technical expertise in dealing with international outbreaks," he said.
"But the other benefit is the smart diplomacy, what it could signal is that despite all of our differences in ideology, trade, politics, that when faced with a common threat to humanity, we come together as a human community to tackle it," Gostin said.

Hi,Patrick -
We've put this in motion - once it's cleared thru CDC, we wi ll send back to this group so NIH com ms can move thru with their editing/revisions .

Let me know if that sounds OK. We will likely not have a cleared version out of CDC until late Saturday at the earliest.
Take care,
Kate

Subject:Redfield/Fauci nCoV op-ed


CDC and NIH folks,


Per some discussion after the presser, we'd like Dr. Redfield and Dr. Fauci to pen an op-ed regarding the reasons/thinking behind the policy announced today. Iassume the right building blocks for it would be the remarks they made today- which Ibelieve you all should have the copy/notes for? Ihave the Secretary's, which we'll be sending around/posting shortly and I'll make sure to re-up it here so you all have it.

It would be great to have a draft of this cleared to get to the WH over the weekend. (I anticipate faster­ than-average clearance from them!)

Please let me know how Ican help with this.


Best,
Patrick

They also would like talking points from us, covering what you would say. These are really just a placeholder. We could resubmit what we sent last time. Is there anything new you would ant icipate saying?

Subject: For review by 11AM Thurs: Sec. Azar coronavirus presser remarks


Hi all,

Attached are draft remarks for the Secretary to deliver tomorrow evening at the scheduled press conference on coronavirus- after which the plan is for Dr. Redfield and then Dr. Fauci, and then whoever from State and OHS (I think?) to speak.

Can CDC, NIAID, OGC, FDA, and ASPR let me know if this looks OK by 11AM tomorrow ? And once CDC and NIAID have their draft TPs, it would be great to see those as well. Thank you!
- Patrick

We have seen each other over the decades. I am the	(b) (6) from NCI

who decreid the lack of information about Eboal since it was limited to fruit bats as a reservoir.
       An idea about testing. Maryland still has testing limited to subjects with symptoms who have contact with people from affected areas or who really ill with a respiratory infection
       Why not forget the contacts and test those with flu-like symptoms without the need for contacts but instead test for flu and if that is negative move on to covid-19.

       That would still be a tremendous demand so ... go to a formal two-tier test where PCR is done with approved PCR primers and if that is positive then the confirmation is with a FDA test for covid-19.
       There are a lot of manufacturers of PCR primers, most clinical labs have PCR machines so that screening tests ought to be supported without a lengthy FDA clearance if it winnows the number of patients who need a formal test.

       You are terrific. Keep it up with common sense as opposed to whatever the top of the administration suggests . I bet that the primer manufacturers would be supportive .

Dear Dr. Fauci,

On behalf of our co-chairs for the winter meeting of The Business Council, David Rubenstein of The Carlyle Group and Ginni Rometty of IBM, we would like to formally invite you to participate in our meeting on February 20-21, 2020 in Washington, D.C. The theme of the meeting is "The Next Decade." (See formal invitation attached as well as list of CEO members).

We would like for you to participate in a 50 minute fireside chat with David Rubenstein (and possibly Dr. Francis Collins) to discuss the current coronavirus as well as what we should expect in the next decade. We want to give our CEOs insights into what the next 10 years will bring in terms of detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases . All conversations are strictly off the record and closed press . We will cover all lodging and transportation.

As you know, The Business Council is comprised of the chief executive officers of the largest global corporations, representing all segments of the economy. We expect at least 150 CEO members, spouses and speaker s to be in attendance.

As a participant you and your spouse are also invited to join us for our special reception, dinner and speaker at the REACH (Kennedy Center) on Thursday, February 20 at 6:30pm. It is the best opportunity for you to meet our CEO members and spouses, speakers and other special guests in an informal atmosphere.

If you are interested and available, please let me know. We can also set up a very brief call with you to discuss any additional details and answer any questions you may have. We look forward to hearing from you and would be honored to have you participate with us again.

Warmest regards, Marlene

Subject: Comment on story about how confident people feel about thei r govt's response to a health epidemic

Hi Dr. Fauci,


I hope all is well. I'm working on a news story tied to the coronavirus outbreak and tying it to how people responded to a recent global lpsos poll about the threat of a major health epidemic in their country in the next 12 months. https://www .ipsos.com/sites/defau lt/files/ct/news/documents/20 19- 11/a-more-dangerous-wor ld-fear-2019.pdf

Iwas hoping to get your comments on this, considering your expertise in infectious disease control. Below are some questions. If you could respond vi.a email, that would be great as Iam on a tight deadline to get this story up. If it's easier to give you a call, Ican do that as well. Please let me know what works best. The story will be published on lpsos.com, on social media and our various country websites. Thank you and I look forward to your response.

1. In our survey of more than 18,500 people in 28 countries done in late last summer, more than half (51%) of people said there was threat of a major health epidemic in their country in the next 12 months w ith people in emerging markets at the top of the list. Are you surprised by this result? It's among the highest reading for this question since the Ebola outbreak in 2014 w hen the percentage climbed to 59%.
2. The U.S. is the only developed country in the top 10 list where most people think a major health epidemic will occur. Why do you think this is?
3. A follow up question to the previous one is how confident people are that their government could protect them or respond effectively if such an outbreak was to occur. Over half globally said they were confident in their gov't's response. Do you think people have a lot of trust in those in power to do the right thing in times of an outbreak?
4. Seven of the top 10 countries where people had the most confidence in govts are in the developed world. How important are developed healthcare systems when it comes to outbreaks like the coronavirus?
5. Likewise, many countries at the bottom of this list are emerging markets. What can govts in these countries do to ease peoples' fears on how they are or will handle an outbreak like the coronavirus?

6.  How difficult is it for governments and health officials to prevent the spreading of a virus like
this before it becomes a pandemic? What measures can be taken?


Please free to add any add itional information that you thin k may be relevant . I hope to hea r from you soon.

Regards, Rajeshni

Subject: Coronavirus - reporter's questions

Hi Dr. Fauci: We are updating our coronavirus story  periodically, keeping it factual and level-headed, and I have seen your comments on NPR Friday and in the NY Times over the weekend,so  I hope you could comment very  briefly for  our  story:

-- What's your expectation for whether this will become a pandemic?
The novel coronavirus outbreak will likely become a pandemic. We know the virus is very transmissible .The infection continues to accelerate and there is efficient transmission in china. If sustained transmission also occurs in other countries throughout the world, the outbreak would fulfill the definitive of a pandemic
-- Pandemic does not necessarily equate to a terrible situation, compared to, say bad flu seasons. What's your expectation on the potential severity of this coronavirus?
It is difficult to predict the severity at this time .Even if the mortality rate of a virus remains low, if it is easily transmissible, the globa limpact can be significant .
-- And your suggestion to people in the U.S. who might be very concerned?

We are treating the emergence of a novelcoronavirus as a very serious public health threat. However, the risk to the general American public remains low at this time.We understand that people may be worried. We ask that people not let fear or panic guide their actions .
Thanks for any help you can provide. Cheers,
Rob

Dear Dr. Gregory Poland

'We're basically at a pandemic now': Mayo Clinic physician on corooavirus

Fyi, I am not a doctor, nurse or medical student nor do I work in the medical field. I am a musician. I am 65 years
old and live in Los Angeles.

A news article published on rt.com .Feb 31, 2020 (see link be low) announced the Chinese have developed a 15 minute test for the Coronavirus, yet I've not seen or heard about this news anywhere else. l had heard there were efforts here to develp a faster test than what is being employed currently by the CDC, but believe its critical the

White House arrange for the new Chinese test to be available in the US everywhere immediately.

This news should have been mentioned by NTH doctor Anthony Fauchi at the White House Briefing on Jan 31, 2020
but was not, nor was it mentioned by Mayor Di Blasio on Feb I at Bellevue Hospital in NY .

At this point, the NTH, CDC and White House should have already obtained the Chinese 15 minute test for the virus and implement at all US medical centers and airports receiving travelers from the infectious regions .

Due to the exponential growth of infection rates from 'seed' individuals who are asymptomatic but don't know they are infectious, whether returning from infection zones or are infected by others already here, I am hoping you and other infectious disease experts waste no time in vigorously pursuading the White House, NTH, CDC and all other agencies as to the necessity to test ALL travelers (not just those who are symptomatic) coming into the country by air and sea with the Chinese 15 minute test as well as pull out all the stops to develop an even quicker test that's portable.

As the numbers of infections increases exponentially in the US and other countries this next 2 to 4 weeks from increasing numbers of asymptomatic 'seed' individuals unknowingly spreading the disease, we are certainly on the precipice of an unstopable runaway epidemic.

What is also desperately needed from the fe.deral government are frank and honest recommendations regarding what is necessary to prevent becoming infected such as:
surgical or constrnction respirators that seal to the face, eye protection goggles, nitrite exam gloves, sanitizer wipes along with specific protoco ls on how not to bring the virus particles back to ones car, home and possessions.

It is imperative that manufacturing of EFFECTIVE respirator masks or equivalent non-disposable respirators be ramped up to huge scale. Without adequate numbers of these, exam gloves and eye protection this country will not be capable of containing this epidemic.

Below this article, T've pasted in a number of useful youtube links of relevant and t imely information in reference .
Thank you very much for your attention to this issue. Jon Markowitz

China develops rapid Coronavirus test that works in under 15 MINUTES 31Jan, 2020  10:48

Scientists in China have reportedly developed an express test which can detect the 2019-nCoV novel coronavirus in under fifteen minutes , in a major breakthrough which will hopefully help stem the tide of infection.

Experts from a tech company based in Wuxi in eastern China's Jiangsu Province, working with the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention , developed the rapid nucleic test kit in just ten days, according to the Xinhua news agency.
The test takes between eight and 15 minutes to produce a result and is currently being mass-manufactured  at a rate of 4,000 kits per day, with the city government in Wuxi exploring effo11s to boost production even further.

The first batch of kits has reportedly already been deployed to the front lines at the epicentre of the outbreak , Wuhan ,
in Hubei province.

RE: A couple of quick questions.




Sylvia:
  Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection . The typica l mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.   It might, however, provide some slight benefit in keep out gross droplets if someone coughs or sneezes on you. I do not recommend that you wear a mask,
particularly since you are going to a vey low risk location.  Your instincts are correct,money is
best spent on medical countermeasures such as diagnostics and vaccines .
  Safe travels. Best regards, Tony

The outbreak of novel coronavirus appears more contagious than seasonal flu and is on par with SARS in 2002 and 2003, studies say

By
Chao Deng and Jeremy Page
Updated Feb. 2,2020 7:34 pm ET
BEIJING-Public-health experts around the world have been crunching numbers about the advance of
China's dangerous new coronavirus to estimate how far and fast it could spread.
Studies published in recent days say the new virus appears to be more contagious than seasonal flu and on par with the similar pathogen behind an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 and 2003. The new virus' mortality rate, however, is far below that of SARS.
China says that as of Sunday there were 5,142 infected people in Wuhan, the locked-down city where the outbreak began. Some scientists estimate based on statistical models that the number could be in the tens of thousands.
As health authorities race to control the outbreak, they are also scramb l ing to figure out,based on imperfect data, how the virus is transmitted, the length of the incubation period and the degree to which people without symptoms can spread the disease .
China's health commission says incubation is generally between three and seven days, with the longest
period being 14 days, and that people can spread the virus before appearing ill. That makes a two-week

quarantine an important prevention measure-and casts doubt on the efficacy of temperature checks, the main screening method at immigration and other checkpoints.
"For a given level of transmissibility, more asymptomatic transmission makes a disease harder to control," said Christi A. Donnelly, a professor at University of Oxford and Imperial College London.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warns against nonessential travel to China, says it isn't clear how easily or sustainably the virus is spreading between people, but notes its ability to spread from infected patients without symptoms to close contacts within about 6 feet.
A study led by a researcher from Boston's Northeastern University-using mathematical probability models based on travel patterns and confirmed international cases-estimated the median number of infections in Wuhan at 31,200 as of Wednesday, compared with that day's official tally of 2,261. Professors at the University of Hong Kong using similar methods published a study in the Lancet on Friday that estimated there were 75,815 infected in Wuhan as of Jan. 25, when official counts were still in the hundreds.
"We think only 1in 20 people who are getting infected are actually being diagnosed" in Wuhan, said Jonathan M. Read, lead author of a study from Britain's Lancaster University that also put Wuhan numbers in the tens of thousands as of Jan. 22. "It's quite a bit more transmissible than seasonal flu." Several recent studies published by scientists estimate that each person infected will, on average, infect two to three others. Epidemiologists call that the reproduction number.
A reproduction number over 2 suggests an epidemic will expand rapidly, while below 1suggests the problem is dwindling. Estimates of the reproduction number differ widely, with some studies using probability models and others based on regression analysis of cases over different time periods.
Still, "they all point in the same direction," said Christian L. Althaus, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland who co-wrote a study estimating the basic reproduction number of the virus at
2.2. "There is a potential threat of a global pandemic if this reproduction number cannot be reduced." In Japan, a local bus driver in his 60s tested positive after he drove tourists from Wuhan, none of whom had exhibited severe symptoms . In Germany, four employees at an auto-parts supplier contracted the virus after attending a training session with a colleague from China, according to the company. The Chinese woman didn't exhibit symptoms, but started feeling ill on her flight home, where she tested positive for the new coronavirus .
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine study by Chinese authors including at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention says the virus spread between people as early as mid-December. The researchers analyzed 425 patients, with more than half of the cases linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market where authorities believe the virus first spread to humans from wild animals.
The researchers started identifying and collecting cases around the start of the year, by interviewing patients, relatives and other close contacts. They estimated the reproduction number at 2.2 and said that the majority of patients weren't hospitalized until after five days of being ill.
Researchers of recent studies cautioned that even their estimates of the virus' reproduction number are based on early and incomplete data and only assess its potential to spread before travel restrictions and other control measures begin. Thereafter, the reproduction number can vary depending on those measures' effectiveness and other circumstances of the outbreak.
Chinese officials have said the outbreak could peak or even begin to subside by Feb. 8, though some overseas experts have suggested the outbreak might not peak for several weeks .
They note that the reproduction number doesn't necessarily predict an outbreak's severity, as many other factors come into play.Measles, for example, has a reproduction number of 12 to 18, but doesn't spread that fast because there is a widely used vaccine.
As yet, there are no vaccines for the new coronavirus, so Chinese authorities are relying on physical intervention measures, including locking down entire cities and forced quarantine.

Recent studies indicate that stringent control measures will be needed not just in China, but in several other countries, to curtail the outbreak .
"This is unprecedented both in terms of the virus and the control measures that have been put in place," says Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropica l Medicine.

Hi Dr. Fauci,


I'm a senior w riter with Canada's public broadcaster, CBC News,and I'm working on a national feature story about the containment efforts of the coronavirus outbreak and what future scenarios could be possible with the coronavirus globally.



You spoke with my colleague Kelly Crowe by phone recently, and I'm hoping you could spare a few minutes by phone to talk about the possibility and implications of the outbreak becoming endemic.

Would it be possible to speak briefly by phone this week? I would only need a few minutes of your time and your expertise would be very beneficial for Canadians in their understanding of this story.

Thanks very much, Adam

Subject: Potential Coronavirus Prophylaxis Dear Dr. Fauci,
You likely do not recall meeting me when Iwas looking at potential
fellowships in 1978, however, I never forgot your enthusiasm. Iwent
out to San Diego and worked with Mike Oldstone between 1979 and 11984.
Idid study a mouse coronavirus while there, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). I focused on genetic resistance, and eventually described a mouse locus for susceptibi lity, which coded for the MHV receptor. On to the present problem of human coronaviruses. Vaccines will take a long time for the current crisis. The angiotensin convertin enzyme 2 receptor has been identifed as the relevant human coronavirus receptor. Iam writing to suggest the investigation of ARBs as  potential blocking agents to either reduce or completely block infection. Perhaps this can be checked. There may still be sufficient untainted supplies of ARBs, such as irbesartan, available, or production can be scaled up, if this truly is the eve of a pandemic.
Wishing you success in this endeavor. I am willing to contribute in any way I can. Please feel free to contact me by e-mail or my cell phone.
Idid do clinical trial while with Mike, and then when Ijoined the

neurology faculty of Jefferson in Philadelphia. Ihave been out on my own since December 1998, but I have never lost my interest in this work. I have some novel ideas on how HIV becomes AIDS, as well.
All the Best,
Robert L Knobler, MD, PhD

Quick retraction of a faulty coronavirus paper was a good moment for science

-------,Hyacinth Empinado/STAT
As fears of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV continued to spread last Friday, an inflammatory new paper appeared on bioRxiv, a preprint server, where scientists post work that hasn't been vetted.
Titled "Uncanny simi l arity of uni que i nserts in the 201 9-nCoV spike protein to HI V-1 gp120 and Gag," the paper claimed to find similarities between the new coronavirus and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS .The use of the word "uncanny" in the title, together with "unlikely to be fortuitous" in the abstract, led some to think that the authors were suggesting the virus had somehow been engineered by humans.
The paper, from academic institutions in New Delhi, India, was critical and alarming, if true. Except that it wasn't.
The paper was almost immediately withdrawn, but not before plenty of handwringing from researchers who complained that the appearance of such shoddy work on a preprint server without vetting by peer reviewers is precisely why the hoary old model of science publishing is better at keeping junk science out of the literature.


Except that's not true, either. The old model has its advantages, to be sure, but it, too, is prone to the menace of pseudoscience, bad data, and other flaws - despite traditional academic journals' army of peer reviewers .And when these publications publish bad or erroneous research, it can take months or years for the papers to be corrected or retracted - if they ever are.
In contrast, the reaction from the scientific community to the bioRxiv paper was swift . In a nutshell, commenters on bioRxiv and Twitter said, the author's methods seemed rushed, and the findings were at most a coincidence . By Saturday morning, bioRxiv had placed a speci al warning on all papers about coronavirus. Later Saturday, the authors commented on their paper, saying they were withdrawing it. And on Sunday, a more forma l retraction appeared: "This paper has been withdrawn by its authors . They intend to revise it in response to comments received from the research community on their technical approach and their interpretation of the results."
All of that happened before a single news outlet with any reach covered the paper, as best we can tell.
But none of it was quite fast enough for some critics. "This is why preprints can be bad," said one scientist on Twitte r.That scientist, Michael Shiloh, sai d he had even used bioRxiv to post preprints. "What bugs me about this preprint is that had this manuscript undergone legitimate peer review, these flaws would have led to a swift rejection and it wouldn't be contributing to the conspiracy theories and fear surrounding this outbreak," Shiloh continued .
History suggests that Shiloh's confidence in peer review's ability to suss out pseudoscience may be a bit
misplaced. The fraudulent 1998 paper that set off the vaccine-autism scare was published in The Lancet, one of the world's leading peer-reviewed medical journals .Other examples - including a paper by an

intelligent design advocate questioning the validity of the second law of thermodynamics as it pertained to evolution - abound.Papers claiming a link between autism and vaccines pop up nearly every year. Preprints can fill a void in times of rapidly changing science
And even when peer-reviewed journals do realize they've been had, retractions can take months or
years .The Lancet took 12 years. Another journal took five years to retract a paper cla i ming that HI V did not cause A I DS.We could go on, and the list includes papers that have never even been corrected. Those who claim preprint servers are dangerous because they lack peer review - bioRxiv has a perfunctory screen i ng process - sometimes acknowledge that journals have had to speed up their game to meet the pressures of an outbreak like coronavirus, or SARS in the early part of this century. Angela Cochran, president of the Society for Scholarly Publishing, a trade group for publishers, said on
Twi tter : "Earlier this week, folks celebrated that coronavirus papers were popping up in preprint servers. Now there is a reminder not to use them to guide clinical practice because they haven't been reviewed. Journals ARE reviewing coronavirus papers and getting [them] pub'd quickly."
Kent Anderson, another publishing industry veteran, put it more bluntly: "Journals Wi n The Coronav irus Race."
Publishers have been looking for ways to score points against - and shut down - preprints for at least ha l f a century .Journals have speedily published a number of important papers on the new coronavirus already, no doubt. Publishing industry champions are often quick to say that speedy peer review does not mean sloppy peer review - even in cases that require massive correct i ons.
It now turns out that one of the world's leading peer-reviewed medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine, published a l etter last week about apparent coronavirus transmission from an asymptomatic person that turns out to be wrong.Such letters to the editor are not typically peer­ reviewed, or at least not as rigorously as a full study . But it's a glaring example of how a peer-reviewed journal can end up getting things wrong. Now we get to wait and see how long it takes NEJM to correct the record.
We'll see whether peer-review champions, who are often unwilling - with some notable and welcome
exceptions - to acknowledge how slow and ineffective correction in science can be, note this apparent failure of one of their gatekeepers . Doing so might, after all, make some people question the expens ive subscription deals uni vers i t i es agree to w i th publi shers,as well as the article processing charges that can run into the thousands of dollars for open access publications .
Peer review can add a valuable filter. But those who work in publishing seem to be so wedded to the
existing process that they can't admit its flaws - or that it might be a good idea to also embrace preprint servers that could upend their business models. Just like in politics, maybe it's time to agree that the publishing process is a messy one, and stop using single episodes, free of context, to score points against one's rivals.
This article has been updated with information about a flawed report in the New England Journal of
Medicine.

Attached is a VP that will go up tomorrow - information for clinicians by Carlos del Rio and Preeti. They
worked on it this weekend -thanks to both.


Attached is a VP from Don and Ken Shine that came in before the epidemic/pandemic- but is definitely related. Going up this week.




                   -it will be published on Friday. A big thank you to Phil and Derek. A RL has also been accepted - it willgo up Thursday .
Icannot thank Stacy and her team (and publishing) - everyone has been working overtime to process manuscripts in record time, put up a microsite; add CME for US clinicians; etc. Mike (and his team) and Ed have been a big help.

As we have done in the past everything wi ll be free to the world.

Iam interviewing Tony Fauci again on Thursday - the last podcast, video has close to 1SOK views - Tony
- as Ihave said many times - is a national treasure .

Subject:2019-nCoV: potential infection on CD4 cells.



Dear Dr. Fauci,

As you realized the Indian researcher published a paper few days ago entitled "Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-l gpl 20 and Gag", which was latterly withdrawn due to the controversia l indication . I did a quick SWISS-MODEL online calculation.  Page 1-3 of the attachment show the flexible loops of inse1tion "l", "2", and "3" originally from V4, V5 and Vl  ofHIV-1 gpl20, respectively. But they are inpresence on the spike protein of both bat and 2019 coronavirus (page 4 and 6). These insertions are potential CD4 binding domains (no proof yet but highly likely) and spatially won't interfere with ACE-2
binding domain (both SARS and 2019 coronavirus target ACE-2 , page 5 and 6). In another word,
the 2019 virus could be potentially dual-targetin g. infecting the lung and potentialJy CD4 T cells
too (like HIV, see page 6)!

It is VERY URGENT to have clinicians follow up the confinned cases su ch as by isolating their CD4 cells and doing RT-PCR. Please reach out to them. Research labs including mine after obtaining Spike protein of 2019-nCoV shall examine its interaction with CD4.

Thank you for your immediate attention. Please keep me anonymous.


God bless us,

It is unfortunate that this error was published, but it still does not really change anything. Rather than rely on rumors, this evening I telephoned one of my colleagues in China who is a highly respected infectious diseases scientist and health official.

The NEJM paper may be incorrect,but according to reputab le Chinese scientists , my statement is correct. Having said that, I have been saying for some time that even if asymptomatic infection occurs, it is very unlikely to be a major driver of the outbreak since most transmissions occur from someone who is asymptomatic.

We have a room on the 11th. Ron is available and holding the date. Think time would work for you guys. Time
would be over lunch. Attendees arrive around 11:30 to grab lunch. Program starts at noon and runs to about 1-
1 :15.  Of course, Tony is more than welcome to come in time for lunch.  But he need not actual ly arrive until shortly
before noon so we can mike him up.

I might also try to get someone from CDC 10 round out the discussion . Bu t if only Tony and Ron, we wil l nm with
it.  Also need to line up the moderator.  But that shouldn't be a problem. Would run options by you first.

Our comms team is reall y interested in pushing this --

Hope all is well and that your 2020 is off to a good, if no doubt, busy start.

Contacting you directly because you have always been my best "go to"person when it comes to Tony and activities at the Institute. Hope you can be of help again.

J would like to do a Public Health Grand Rounds session 011the coronavirus here at our Aspen DC offices - hopefully on February l J (from 12 until about 1:15pm; lunch is made available to attendees). Ron KJain, former Obama Ebola czar -- is available -- and hope Tony might be as well. Tony and Ron are my first two choices. Perhaps we might add someone from CDC.lsuspect we could get some good press, especially if Tony is in the lineup .

Know bow tetTibly busy Tony is, but hope!his might be a possibility. Any chance? As always, many thanks -

Hi Dr. Fauci: We are updating our coronavirus story periodically, keeping it factual and level-headed, and I have seen your comments on NPR Friday and in the NY Times over the weekend, so Ihope you could comment very briefly for our story:

-- What's your expectation for whether this will become a pandemic?

-- Pandemic does not necessarily equate to a terrible situation, compared to,say bad flu seasons . What's your expectation on the potential severity of this coronavirus?
-- And your suggestion to people in the U.S. who might be very concerned? Thanks for any help you can provide.
Cheers,
Rob

Dear Tony,


Ienjoyed your corona virus presentation at ASM Biothreats, and understand why you couldn't linger .


I'm writing with an update on our horsepox-based vaccine program. On Wednesday, we presented a poster on our further work with TNX-801 (horsepox) as a potential vaccine for smallpox and monkeypox . We found that vaccination of cynos with TNX-801 resulted in sterilizing immunity (no lesions) in 8/8 animals compared to a synthesized ACAM-like vaccinia which resulted in protection, but
lesions on 2/3 animals. More complete information is on the poster attached, which is available on our website at (https://content.eguisolve.net/tonixpharma/media/10929ac27f4fb5f5204f5cf41d59al21.pdf
). The press release is also attached and available on our website at (https :(/jr.tonixpharma .com/press­ releases/ detail/1186).

-We'd welcome the opportunity to discuss the data w ith you and your team.

Steinberg, Danielle
Conrad, Patricia (NIH/NIAID)  [E];Billet, Courtney {NIH/NIAID)  [E] RE: PBS Nature inquiry about Coronavirus




Danielle:
   Many coronaviruses exist in animal reservoirs, particularly in bats.	Remember that for t he SARS outbreak in 2002, bats infected palm civet cats who were sold in live/wet markets and the civet cats spread the virus to human . Same for MERS - bats to camels to humans.  You ask that there have been animal markets for a long time, and so why now.   The fact is that this is likely pure chance+/- more interactions in the human-animal interface .  Anima lviruses  mutate and most of the time the mutations have no significant impact on virus transmission to humans.   Sometimes they mutate and a llow single "dead end" transmissions to individual humans with no efficiency in going human to human and so we get individual infections and no outbreak as we have seen with HSNl and H7N9 influenzas that jump from chickens to humans but do not go from human to human.   And then rarely, animal viruses mutate and the mutation allows them  not only to jump species to humans, but to a lso efficiently spread from human to
human . That is what we saw in SARS and now we see this with 2019-nCoV,which
seems to have adapted itself very well to human to human transmission, as per what is happening in China .
  I hope that this is helpful. Best regards,
Tony

Hari Sreenivasan of PBS NewsHour suggested I reach out to you with a specific nature question that
we're writing about. I hope you'll be able to give us some insights - I'm sure you're extremely busy!


We're wondering about the impact of animals on the virus and specifically, why now? Presumably, China has been using animal markets/wildlife trade in these exact ways for a while, so what changed or is different now to cause this illness and outbreak? Any other information you can provide on how animals are involved would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you! Best,
Danielle Steinberg

Dear Professor Fauci,



l am Enrica Battifoglia of the Italian news agency ANSA, I already have had the pleasure to
interview you several times at the AIDS world conferences.




I would like to ask you some questions about Coronoravirus 2019-nCoV, to be published on the ANSA Science web page (www.ansa.it/scienza), the main on.line science news resource in Italy with over l .5M contacts each month. I am sure that your clarity and competence will be highly valuable to put some much-needed order among so many contrasting news and data, and would be much appreciated by our readers .



1) Do the current available data allow to understand the threat level of  coronarivus 2019-nCoV in terms of both  lethality and diffusion speed, and about the possible evolution scenarios of the disease?




2) What exactly we know about its modes of transmission, especially from people who do not yet have the symptoms?




3) Are the genetic sequences provided by China enough to start working on a vaccine?

What are the technical times to develop a working vaccine in terms of scientific research, and what are the approx times for the necessary legal ce1iifications, and for industrial production and distribution?




4) 2019-nCov is the third Coronavirus aggressive for humans that has appeared in the East in the last 20 years and in 2009 the vims responsible for the flu pandemic too did come from China : what sort of preventive measures could be practicable to reduce the risk of repetition of these events?



Thank you so much for your time your attention!

RE: Coronavirus vaccine




Joe:
 Thanks for the note. The has nothing to do with the va lidity of the test. We see this with other viruses when you look at shedding.	When there is a low titer of virus, any specific site (in this case a nose or throat swab) may vary between positive and negative even though the person is clearly still infected.	It could be that the virus is there in the throat at one point and cleared at another and comes back again. Alternatively, it may be that the virus is always there, but at different titers and at some points it is present below the sensitivity of the test, even though the test is in general quite sensitive .
  Hope that this is helpful. Best regards,
Tony

Subject: RE: Coronavirus vaccine Hi Tony,
It's been nice hearing you on the various press conferences ...can't believe we're still both doing this.


Have a question about something Redfield said in Friday in the White House briefing about nCoV. He
said using their PCR assay, the virus can be detectable one day, then not the next, then detectable. I'm curious about this. Isee a few possibilities:
1. The test isn't as sensitive as CDC hopes
2. The sample was taken from different places
3. With low viral titer, it may seem like the virus "disappears" from one day to the next.
4. The virus may be hanging out in the terminal bronchioles, and only pop up to the upper
respiratory system from time to time.


Am Ion the right track? Would you have a few minutes today to record an interview with me? Joe

Too soon to predict. It probably will evolve into a widespread infection (pandemic) wirh lower mortality than we
are now seeing (2%).   More similar to 2009 H INl flu than SARS even though the viius (coronavitus) is in the same family ofviiuses as SARS.

H ·I1.

Iread that you are an expert working for NIAID and that you got interviewed about treatments for the
coronavirus.


Iam a Swedish physician specialized in clinical chemistry.	(b)(6) and wanted to share a hypothesis Ihave. I believe that some patients who are seriously ill in corona virus (or flue/SARS) with lung symptoms have a lack of normal/well functioning Alpha-1-antitrypsin for example PiZZ. Alpha- 1antitrypsin is an acute phase reactant and increases in sick people. Ihave seen that the Alpha-1- antitrypsin level can be elevated in a severely ill person (HlNl) if measured in a laboratory, even
thought the patient was homozygous for mutations in the Alpha-1-antitrypsin gene. An elevated level of Alpha-1antitrypsin is misleading and can result in the physician believing that there is nothing w rong with the patients function of Alpha-1-antitrypsin.


Ialso guess that critically ill ECMO-treated patients with lung symptoms might benefit from receiving
Alpha-1antiprotease inhibitor in addition to other medications given to them. What do you think?


I believe that this information can contribute in understanding why some supposedly healthy individuals gets really sick and even die in corona virus, flue/HlNl or SARS.	(b)(4





Iwould appreciate if you replied shortly to me so that I know that my e-mail has been read. Best regards, Ulrica Molstad, M.D.

Subject: 2019-nCoV Testing for Public Health Labs Tony:
I hope this email finds you well. Over the past 48 hours, PrEP4All has received multiple requests from leaders of public health departments and public health practitioners to begin publicly pressuring CDC/HHS to ensure that properly equipped public health labs (besides CDC's lab in Atlanta) can perform real time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) testing for 2019 Novel-Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Our understanding is that given the public health emergency declared by HHS,an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA is required for public health labs to perform their own lab developed test for 2019-nCoV, even if it is using the CDC's published qRT-PCR protocol and primer/probe sequences (
https: //www . cdc . govIcoronavi rus/2019-ncov/downloads/ rt-pcr-panel -for-detection-instructions. pdf )
,and the lab is capable of handling BSL3+ samples.


We understand the extreme delicateness of this situation, and also that it is outside of our normal wheelhouse. But given the concerns of our colleagues in the public health sector, we thought it was important to give you a heads up regarding this request .

Let us know if there is anyway we can help. Sincerely,

Due to  the new coronavirus outbreak  and the rapidly  escalating global  spread,  lots of questions are raised regarding the role of micronutrients in supporting the inmmne system. DSM has reached out to me with a request to organize rapidly a focused expert panel in order to
establish expert guidance summarizin g key points with respect to the role of micronutrients  in
supporting our body's immune response, in light of the cunent general consciousness that among other factors nutrition is important in combatting infectious diseases. Peter Van Dael, head of Nutrition Science & Advocacy, is responsible for the coordination of this activity at DSM.

l agreed to take on this challenge at1d therefore  intend to organize this expert panel Lhrough webinar in order to manage the challenges related to busy agendas and travel within the next week, if possible. The webinar is expected to last for about 3 hours maximum and would be facilitate through the distribution of a short backgrow1d document I will share in order to facilitate the discussion.

lwi ll try to reach out to you tomorrow by phone in order to review whether you would be available for this  engagement  and whether  you  would  you have potentia l questions prior  to agreeing  to  participate.

With our best regards,

Manfred	Peter

Interesting to see how they view outbreaks .....
Coronavirus news over the weekend was a small net positive (alth ough there were plenty of negatives). Encouragingly, doctors appear to be having some success treating patients with existing antiviral drugs - GILD's remdesivir improved the clinical conditions of a coronavirus patient in Washington state (WSJ) while Thailand said it had achieved good results using antiviral drugs originally designed
for the flu and HIV (Bloomberg). It's way too early to tell whether these drugs will
perfonn we111n other patients (and a vaccine is still some time away), but the progress noted in the US and Thailand is positive. The PBOC said it would inject CNY l .2T worth of liquidity on Monday 2/3 to ensure markets operate smoothly when they reopen from the New Year holiday (this works out to about CNY150B of net  incremental liquidity given CNY1.05T ofreverse reports are set to mature on Monday). Tbe gov't also announced other steps (including waiving equity  ownership limits for some insurers) aimed to bolstering market confidence . The global coronavirus case count continues to rise (it now stands at -l5K as of Sunday morning withe death toll north of 300) while more travel restrictions are being imposed by governments and companies around the world (Apple said it would shutter all its stores and offices in China until Feb 9). Accord ing to a CNBC update, areas of China responsible for -80% of GDP and .-90% of exports are set to stay closed until atleast Feb  10.

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Iam a mere clinician. But Ihave published repeatedly on a therapy which, I believe, will remedy patients with coronavirus and spare a possible catastrophe, if the virus is as lethal as it appears.
The therapy is ozone.It can be performed, depending on the method, for mere pennies in materials. It is not patentable, so, it lacks profitability needed for some payback for the basic research to get it "approved".
It attacks a key vulnerabi lity on this virus and even Ebola. We got to 5 Ebola cases in Sierra Leone. All 5
recovered almost immediately. No sequela . No one has reported anything like that.
Ihave used ozone therapy for 33 years, ;longer than anyone in North America. It absolutely changed my practice. Iwrite essentially no prescriptions for antibiotics,including for Lyme disease . This therapy, I recently published, might be the solution the world desperately needs for the emerging crisis in resistant infections.

Iam attaching 2 papers Irecently published on ozone therapy, And a manuscript we just got done to address corona virus, which Iam trying to get published. It is not easy. The medical world is vested in Pharmaceuticals.

Iurge you to please look at this. Not patentable, it will never be a darling of industry. But just for that reason (dirt cheap), it could be a savior for thousands or more who might die from a pandemic. I am coming to you about this as one physicist came to President Roosevelt about harnessing the power of the atom at the dawn of world war 2. I do hope you will take note of what Iam forwarding to you .



The first file is a word document I am seeking to get published. Usually, an author will hold up on making material like this public until he get published. However,with lives immediately on the line,we want to alert people that the does exist an available very inexpensive and extremely safe medical treatment for this and other infections.

If you have questions, please contact me here. Sincerely,

Hi Or . Fauci, you might not remember me from my previous email. I'm a Brazilian who asked you some months ago about the influenza virus differences across regions.I recently traveled to DC and NY and had a great time there (before the Corona Virus outbreak)

I have some specific questions about the new Corona Virus, and would be very grateful if you can
answer them:


1- Using available data, I've made a simple spreadsheet attempting to predict the virus behavior :https://docs.google .com/spreadsheets /d/1DAHQt FzXO­ FKU405k8p864JBVHAlfzsHQghuywaTNbE/ed it#gid=O
I've used exponential trend, although it seems to be spreading slower than the expected, I'd like to
know if there's an accurate model for predicting this virus. Also, I assume virus don't always spread
exponentially?


2- I listened to your interview podcast https://edhub .ama-assn.org/j n-learning/audio-player/18197306 . Really amazing content. Let's assume this is going to be a worldwide outbreak. How can I get prepared for the worst? Buy water, dry food,stay indoors, withdraw money, etc?

Once again,I'd like to thank you very much for reading this email. Ibet this is a very busy time for you,
so it means a lot to me Thank you,
Rafael

This is a preliminary study. Considering the grave situation , it was shared in BioRxiv as soon as possible to have creative discussjon on the fast evolution of SARS-like corona viruses. It was not our intention to feed into the co11spiracy theories and no such claims are made here. Wh ile we appreciate the criticisms and comments provided  by scientific colleagues at BioRxiv  forum and elsewhere , the story has been differently interpreted and shared by social media and news platforms . We have positively received all criticisms and comments. To avoid further misinterpretation  and confusions world-over. we have decided to withdraw the current version of the preprint and will get back with a revised version after reanalysis, addressing tbe comments and concerns.

 Thanks for the note.	There is a lot of communications between scientists in China and their colleagues in the USA ,many with whom they have been collaborating prior to the outbreak. There is no real "coordination" of this response since we do not know who is doing what until we are told -just like you have done here. Dr.Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist at WHO is organizing a meeting on Feb. 11-12 in Geneva to try and develop a research agenda for nCoV.  I am sure that Chinese scientists will be there.   It might be helpful to contact her.  Her e-mail address is		CbH .
I hope that this is helpful. I will follow-up with a call.

Dear All,


Iam delighted to inform you that WHO is organizing a global research partners forum on February 11th and 12th in Geneva,  to discuss research priorities related to the novel Corona virus .The expected outcome is a research roadmap with clearly defined priorities and a governance framework to take each
thematic area forward. Several thematic areas will be considered at the meeting, namely:virus,
diagnostics; natural history and transmission; clinical; therapeutics; vaccines; ethics; regulatory science; animal health; data/samples analysis and sharing and; social sciences. We believe that this meeting will be critical in consensus building on the most important research questions,as well as in building global partnerships and collaborations to take this work forward.

This meeting is being organized in partnership with GLOPID Rand is being supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, DFID, Wellcome Trust and several other partners. The secretariat within WHO is the R&D blueprint, co-chaired by Dr Mike Ryan and myself.

As the head of an agency that would play an important role in addressing this new viral outbreak, either by undertaking or funding research,or both,Itake great pleasure in inviting you to this meeting. I apologize for the short notice, but you will understand that we have had to plan this in the past few days, keeping in mind the evolving situation.

Kindly let me know if you (or your nominee) will be able to attend and if you need any support from us. Please copy	(b)	and	(b) (6) in your response.

With best wishes, Soumya
Chief Scientist

Thank you. Dr. Catharine provided me useful information. As the epidemic develops,here are a few new questions to ask. Chinese readers want to know the opinions of foreign independent experts

1Some media said Wuhan virus' fatality rate approaches that of the flu, saying that people need not panic. What do you think of this view? In reality, Chinese residents are already scared and are already rushing to buy masks.

2 RO is a developing number, and it is not easy to calculate. Does it make sense to talk about RO at this stage?

3 You had talked about asymptomatic patients, and how public health workers should treat asymptomatic people? AND why are some viral infections asymptomatic? Can they wear masks to help prevent epidemics?

4 To what extent will the closure of Wuhan prevent the epidemic? looking forward to your reply.
Best




Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci,


I am Tao Sun, a reporter from Beijing. Iam currently writing reports for the MIT Technology Review (Chinese) .

JAMA published your article Coronavirus Infections-More Than Just the Common Cold, and Xinhua News Agency reported this article. Here are some questions I would like to ask you.

1Some people think that it is not necessary to develop a new vaccine against SARS or coronavirus in

Wuhan. The reason is that, firstly, there is no commercial interest to pharmaceutical manufacturers, and secondly,such outbreaks may not return after the extinction.
What do you think of these views7


2 For the Wuhan virus vaccine being developed, the epidemic is likely to be eliminated after three months, so is it still necessary to develop a vaccine?

3 You can talk about SARS. How much does a vaccine against SARS actually play?


Looking forward to your reply.

Subject: Coronavirus issues Hi, Tony:
As this progresses, and as other news items quiet,  Iam concerned that this is not being handled like the
2009 pandemic when you and Rich Besser functioned as something like a tag team.This gets really tricky when public health interventions are the way SARS was handled and remain the focus. Iam being contacted by the media currently, not because I was in Beijing at the end of SARS but because of general epidemiology credentials  I am trying to put things into context based on past history, even though I know other sensational information may come to light which will further muddy the waters .And we know who will be the main muddiers

Keiji put me on the 2009 WHO Emergency Committee as a non-governmental person who was not bound by clearances etc  Iam trying to figure out if Ican play that role here  Ihave not yet been contacted by Elizabeth Cohen, our mutual friend, but Iam sure Iwill.The one thing I can do is to try to

Tony & Hugh, in follow up, the PHS has informed all PHS officers that as of 2/3 they are subject to deployment for coronavirus work  "without supervisory approval", meaning that if needed, officers can be deployed and assigned anywhere, for indefinite periods, by the Assistant Secretary of Health.


We are hearing that many officers, especially physicians and nurses, may be
deployed for quarantine efforts and to assist State agencies.


I haven't heard anything personally, but just want to let you know. These deployment orders can come with almost no advance warning, although I don't expect that.

My name is Robert Vera .I am H years old. Ilive in	(b)(6) Ecuador South America . Here in Ecuador in
1999 in shrimp farms in Ecuador there was a lethal disease among shrimp called the white spot virus syndrome . He appeared in 1999 in Ecuador and made shrimp sick and eliminated them. In China it appeared in 1993. White spot virus syndrome is caused by a virus from the nimaviridae family that infects a vibran parahaemolitycus . Iapplied more than 10 billion liters of natural and organic biological molecules of my invention for 10 years from 2002 to 2011 in more than 10 thousand hectares of shrimp farms. These molecules have antiviral characteristics and inhibit the glycoproteins of viruses. These glycoproteins are what open cell receptors to infect and replicate. Also these natural molecules invented in	(b)(  Ecuador in 2001 inhibit the cytokinins that inflame hepatopancreas. Cytokinins cause the desquamation of epithelial cells from tubules that end up collapsing to the liver and shrimp pancreas. These viruses infect the parahaemolitycus vibrating bacteria and create an incurable syndrome in the shrimp. In 2002 we defeated this disease and controlled it ... with this Ecuador to produce little shrimp, now in 2019 it is the number one in the world to export shrimp. In the same way, the coronavirus 2019- nCoV Wuhan infects the pneumococci of the lung and the respiratory syndrome develops. Wuhan coronavirus is the seventh among the coronaviruses after sars and mers. Another 4 are simpler in animals that cause the flu. 2019-nCoV causes 2% of deaths. There are 250 dead as of January 31, 2020 and more than 10 thousand infected in China. 20 countries have infections. It is transmitted even
without symptoms and its incubation is 2 to 14 days.
We can spray with more than 1000 million liters of these virus inhibitory molecules throughout Wuhan. 1million hectares (10,000 m2} can be fumigated by fumigation planes as they are made in banana plantations in Ecuador. We can inhibit all viruses with bacteria and biological molecules to inhibit viruses. And we can give them more than 100 million liters to take for more than 100 million liters for humans to more than 100 million inhabitants of the entire province of Hubei in China, so that they do not transmit coronaviruses ... and the seriously ill can also heal They are natural antibacterial, anviral and antifungal biological molecules ... they are immune regenerating cell bioimmunmodulators and immune boosting immune response in immunocompromised  people who have diabetes and high blood pressure. Others may have cytokinin and immunoglobulin problems. We can finish with the 2019-nCoV Wuhan in the environment and in humans so be found in the lungs whose epithelial cells are already collapsing with an increase in inflammation and difficulty breathing. We can beat the coronaviruses

throughout China.

Coronavirus Lurking in Feces May Revea l Hidden Risk of Spread 2020-02-0106:55 :00.469 GMT



By Jason Gale
(Bloomberg) -- While doctors have focused on respiratory samples from pneumonia cases to identify coronavirus patients,
they might have ignored a less apparent and hidden source of the
spread: diarrhea.
The novel coronavirus was detected in the loose stool of
the first U .S. case -- a finding that hasn't featured among case reports from  Wuhan, China, the epicenter  of the  outbreak. However, that doesn't surprise scientists  who  have studied coronaviruses , nor doctors  familiar  with the  bug that caused SARS.
Diarrhea occurred in about 10-20% of patients afflicted
with severe acute respiratory syndrome about 17 years ago and was the source of an explosive SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens residential complex in Hong Kong.
SARS and Wuha n viruses bind to the same distinctly shaped
protein receptors in the body that are expressed in the lungs
and intestines, making these organs the primary targets for both viruses, sa id Fang Li, an associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota.
The discovery of the Wuhan v irus, dubbed 2019-nCoV ,in the
fecal material of the 35-year-old man treated at the Providence

Regional Medical Center Everett in Washington is "interesting," said Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for infectious disease at Washington's Department of Health.
"That adds to the knowledge about this," he told reporters on a conference call Friday. "It's not only excreted in your respiratory secretions, it's also secreted in your stool." Read More: What You Need to Know About the Spreading Coronavirus
Researchers don't yet know how exactly 2019-nCoV spreads from person to person, but suspect it's most likely from coming into contact with virus -containing droplets that could be emitted by an infected person's cough and transferred to their hands or surfaces and objects.

Face Masks


That's led to a run on face masks. But those may be of limited benefit in the event the virus is being transmitted via the fecal-oral route, said John Nicholls, a clinical professor
of pathology at the University of Hong Kong.
Squat latrines, common in China, lacking covers and hands
that aren't washed thoroughly with soap and water after visiting the bathroom could be a source of virus transmission, said Nicholls, who was part of the research team that isolated and characterized the SARS virus .
A virus-laden aerosol plume emanating from a SARS patient with diarrhea was implicated in possibly hundreds of cases at
Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003. That led the city's researchers to understand the importance of the virus's spread through the gastrointestinal tract, and to recognize both the limitation of face masks and importance of cleanliness and hygiene, Nicholls said in an interview.
"I think in Wuhan, that would be a very likely place where you might get the transmission" from fecal material, he said. "If it's using the same receptor as for SARS, I can't see why it shouldn't be replicating in the gut."
Nicholls and colleagues at the University of Hong Kong are testing laboratory models of human tissues and specimens to understand where and how the Wuhan virus replicates, he said.

Emerging Evidence


Doctors have reported diarrhea infrequently in 2019-nCoV patientsadmitted to Wuhan hospitals, though it's been more prominent among reported cases outside the city, including members of a Shenzhen family infected in Wuhan, and more recently in the first U.S.case in Washington state.That patient experienced a two-day bout of diarrhea from which a

sample tested positive.
The lab in Washington didn't attempt to grow the virus from that specimen, said Lindquist, the state epidemiologist, "because it wasn't going to add anything to his care."
Many of the emerging coronaviruses are so-called pneumoenteric viruses, meaning they can replicate both in the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal system, said Ralph Barie, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has studied coronaviruses for decades.
Overwhelmed by hundreds of severely sick pneumonia
patients, doctors in Wuhan might not have focused on any gastric signs, Barie said in a phone interview.

'So  Overwhelmed'


"The Chinese are so overwhelmed at the moment and trying to do a combination of treating patients and dealing with the scope of the outbreak, and then trying to get out papers that describe what's happening," he said.
Any virus in stool is more likely to be present during the acute phase of an infection, occuring before hospitalized
patients develop a life-threatening complication known as acute
respiratory distress syndrome, Barie said.
"I have also spent most of my time focusing on the
respiratory tract symptomology rather than the gut because of the relationship between these different emerging viruses and acute respiratory distress syndrome," he said.
Zijian Feng, deputy director general of Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention, and colleagues released a report Wednesday on the first 425 Wuhan cases, and noted that early infections that didn't appear to display typical signs -- such
as fever and viral pneumonia -- or had mild symptoms might have been missed.
"The initial focus of case detection was on patients with
pneumonia, but we now understand that some patients can present
with gastrointestinal symptoms," Feng and co-authors said in their report, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Emerging evidence of virus-containing diarrhea warrants further investigation, said Peter Collignon, a professor of clinical medicine at the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra, who advises the Australian government on infection  control.
"This is something new," Collignon said in an interview.
"We presume it's respiratory droplets, but with SARS there was evidence of other routes. We have to keep an open mind."

Subject:FOR YOUR REVIEW : Staff Communication on Novel Coronavirus Good afternoon, Dr. Fauci and team :
Working in coordinat ion with OHR, ORS, OIR, and others, we have developed two communication products to address questions/concerns that are being raised by NIH staff related to the novel coronavirus.The two products are:

1. All staff emailfrom Dr. Collins to provide general information and guidance to NIH staff
2. QA for use by Executive Officers (not for broad distribution) on human resources flexibilities in response to coronavirus

These products are provided for your review and guidance. We also plan to share with HHS for review/awareness . The current plan to disseminate these products on Monday. We look forward to your input.

Dear Dan,
Here are some more specifics regarding the event we will holding at Hudson Institute on novel coronavirus . The meeting will be on February 10th, from 2:00 - 3:30 pm in the Stern Conference Center at Hudson Institute, which is located at 1201 Pennsylvania Avenue , NW, 4th floor, Washington, DC 20004.

We also have the executive conference room reserved from 1:30 pm on. Please plan to arrive around then, so that you can talk with Senator Lieberman and the other speakers before the event starts at 2:00 pm. Just ask the receptionist to direct you where to go.

Here are the speakers:
 Former Senator Joe Lieberman, co-chair, Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense
 Dr. Julie Gerberding, Executive Vice President & Chief Patient Officer, Strategic Communications, Global Public Policy and Population Health, Merck;former Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
 Dr. Billy Karesh, ex officio , Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense; Executive VP, EcoHealth Alliance
 The Honorable Tim Morrison,Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute; former Deputy Assistant to President Trump for National Security; former Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Weapons of Mass Destruction and Biodefense
 Mr. Eric Brown,Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute

 Dr. Daniel S. Chertow (CAPT - US Public Health Service), Head, Emerging Pathogens Section, Critical Care Medicine Department, Clinical Center & Laboratory of lmmunoregulation,  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (invited)
The setting will be relatively informal. Scooter Libby will first introduce Senator  Lieberman . Then Senator Lieberman will make a short opening statement, and look to Billy to set the stage and talk about the zoonotic nature of the disease, associated disease management considerations , etc., in about 5 minutes. The Senator will then ask each of the other speakers to say a few words from their perspectives . After that, Senator Lieberman will ask some questions of the group , allowing you all to answer and converse. All of this should take about 45 minutes. Then we will allow the audience to ask questions .



We are planning for Senator Lieberman to moderate the discussion and take questions from the audience, but if for some reason he cannot do so, then Billy Karesh will .



I hope you will be able to make it, Dan. Let me know if you have any questions (and if you will be able to make it, of course) and I look forward to seeing you on February 10th.

Dear Dr. Chertow,
I am the Executive Director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, co-chaired by former Senator Joe Lieberman and Governor Tom Ridge. Our fiscal sponsor is Hudson Institute, one of the think tanks here in DC. Hudson lnstitute's chair of the board of trustees (Sarah May Stern) has asked Hudson Institute to run a 90 minute meeting on the novel coronavirus situation. Hudson has asked us to help them pull a brief meeting together in short order.

Considering your experience on the ground dealing with other outbreaks, Hudson Institute invites you to speak at this event. In addition to one of Hudson lnstitute's China experts, we are also seeing whether Senator Lieberman and Governor Ridge are available to speak.

Here are the dates they are a looking at: February 6, February 1o, and February 13. Could you let me know if you are available and if so, when on those dates?


Thank you for your consideration , Dan. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Asha

HiTony,


Thanks for sharing. Yes, I saw this earlier today and both Eddie and myself are actually quoted in it. It's a great article, but the problem is that our phylogenetic analyses aren't able to answer whether the sequences are unusual at individual residues, except if they are completely off. On a phylogenetic tree the virus looks totally normal and the close clustering w ith bats suggest that bats serve as the reservoir . The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered.

We have a good team lined up to look very critically at this, so we should know much more at the end of the weekend. Ishould mention that after discussions earlier today, Eddie,Bob, Mike,and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionar y theory. But we have to look at this much more closely and there are still further analyses to be done, so those opinions could still change.

Best, Kristian

Mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the

By Jon CohenJan. 31,2020, 6:20 PM

That string of apparent gibberish is anything but: It's a snippet of a DNA sequence from the viral
pathogen, dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV}, that is overwhelming China and frightening the entire world. Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from patients-53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database. These viral genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species.They have also given glimpses into what this newly discovered virus physically looks like,how it's changing,and how i t might be stopped.
"One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single
introduction into humans and then human-to-human spread," says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China,in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market's environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences,most researchers say, also knock dow n the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan .
In all, 2019-nCoV has nearly 29,000 nucleotides bases that hold the genetic instruction book to produce the virus. Although it's one of the many viruses whose genes are in the form of RNA, scientists convert the viral genome into DNA, with bases known in shorthand as A, T,C, and G, to make it easier to study. Many analyses of 2019-nCoV's sequences have already appeared on
v i rological.org, nextstrain.org, preprint servers like bioRxiv, and even in peer-reviewed journals. The sharing of the sequences by Chinese researchers allowed public health labs around the wor ld to develop their own diagnostics for the virus, which now has been found in 18 other countries. (Science's news stories on the outbreak can be found here.)

When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available,researchers placed it on a family tree of known coronaviruses-which are abundant and infect many species-and found that it was  most closely related to relatives found in bats. A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reported on 23 January on bioRxiv that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% similar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outbreak was also in China more than 15 years ago . But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relationship to bat viruses, and sequence data make a powerful case that it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleot ides. That's one reason why many scientists suspect there's an "intermed iary" host species-or several-between bats and 2019-nCoV.
According to Bedford's analysis, the bat coronaviru s sequence that Shi Zheng-Li's team highlighted,
dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On nextstrai n.org, a site he co­ founde d,Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below) that include bat, civet, SARS, and 2019-nCoV sequences. (The trees are interacti ve-by dragging a computer mouse over them,it's easy to see the differences a nd similarities between the sequences.)

Bedford's analyses of RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV suggest that the two viruses shared a common ancestor 25 to 65 years ago, an estimate he arrived at by combining the difference in nucleotides between the viruses with the presumed rates of mutation in other coronaviruses. So it likely took decades for RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV.
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly has a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels. And the phylogenetic tree from Shi's bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see.

The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that differentiate strains in infected people, and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very recently. But it remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. 'There's a very large gray area between viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans," says Vincent Munster,
a virologist at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses
in bats, camels, and others species.
Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but whether it was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases-27 of the first 41 in one report,26 of 47 in another -were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not.This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere .

Acco rding to X inhua,the state-run news agency, "environmental sampling" of the Wuhan seafood market has fou nd evidence of 2019-nCoV. Of the 585 samples tested,33 were positive for 2019-nCoV and all were in the huge market's western portion, which is w here wildlife were sold. "The positive tests from the wet market are hugely important," says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who collaborated with the first group to publicly release a 2019-nCoV sequence."Such a high rate of positive tests would strongly imply that animals in the market played a key role in the emergence of the virus."
Yet there have been no preprints or official scientific reports on the sampling, so it's not clear which, if any, animals tested positive. "Until you consistently isolate the virus out of a single species, it's really, really difficult to try and determine what the natural host is," says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research.
One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a batch of recently infected animals sold at different marketplaces. Or an infected animal trader could have transmitted the virus to different people at different markets. Or, Bedford suggests, those early cases could have been infected by viruses that didn't easily transmit and sputtered out. "It would be hugely helpful to have just a sequence or two from the marketplace [environmental sampling] that could illuminate how many zoonoses occurred and when they occurred," Bedford says.



















A research group sent fecal and other bodily samples from bats they trapped in caves to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to search for coronaviruses.
EcoHealth Alliance
In the absence of clear conclusions about the outbreak's origin, theories thrive, and some have been scientifica lly shaky. A sequence analysis led by Wei Ji of Peking University and published online by the Journal of Medical Virology received substantial press coverage when it suggested that "snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV." Sequence specialists, however, pilloried j!.
Conspiracy theories also abound. A CBC News report about the Canadian government deporting Chinese scientists who worked in a Winnipeg lab that studies dangerous pathogens was di storted on social media to suggest that they were spies who had smuggled out coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is the premier lab in China that studies bat and human coronaviruses, has also come under fire. "Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research," read a headline on a story in The Washington Post that focused on the facility.
Concerns about the institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new biosafety level 4 lab and included molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened

with lab workers handling SARS in Beij ing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an ex peri ment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright questioned the accuracy of Bedford's calculation that there are at least 25 years of evolutionary distance between RaTG13 -the virus held in the Wuhan virology institute-and 2019-nCoV, arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through different hosts before humans. Ebright tells Sciencelnsider that the 2019-nCoV data are "consistent with entry into the human population as a natural accident."
Shi did not reply to emails from Science, but her longtime collaborator, disease ecologist Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, dismissed Ebright's conjecture. "Every time there's an emerging disease, a new virus, the same story comes out: This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus," Daszak says. "It's just a shame. It seems humans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face. There's this incredible diversity of viruses in wildlife and we've just scratched the surface. Within that diversity, there will be some that can infect people and within that group will be some that cause illness."



















A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the EcoHealth Alliance have trapped bats in caves all over China, like this one in Guangdong, to sample them for coronaviruses.
EcoHealth Alliance
Daszak and Shi's group have for 8 years been trapping bats in caves around China to sample their feces and blood for viruses. He says they have sampled more than 10,000 bats and 2000 other  species .They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the
SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13-it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province. "We cannot assume that just because this virus from Yunnan has high sequence identity with the new one that that's the origin," Daszak says, noting that only a tiny fraction of coronaviruses that infect bats have been discovered . "I expect that once we've sampled and sampled and sampled across southern China and central China that we're goingto find many other viruses and some of them will be closer [to 2019-nCoV]."
It's not just a "curious interest" to figure out what sparked the current outbreak, Daszak says. "If we
don't find the origin, it could still be a raging infection at a farm somewhere, and once this outbreak dies, there could be a continued spillover that's really hard to stop. But the jury is still out on what the real origins of this are."

Dear Dr Fauci, I enjoyed your recent editorial in JAMA re Coronaviruses
Although the viral disease is not an area of my expertise, you might want to take a look at a hypothesis we had proposed, long ago (back in the era of SARS), re the potential of immune-modulating  Coronavirus infection natural history with blockage of aminopeptidase  N.
Iam not aware of any studies whether aminopeptidase is a receptor of China 2019-

Dear Dr. Fauci - We met long ago when I was a young health policy staff person at the Children's Defense Fund and you gave a talk on HIV/AIDS at the annual CDF conference around 1984-86.


When Iserved on the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) during the 1990-91measles epidemic and helped to write the measles white paper, I had other occasions to hear your insights.

Since that time, I have frequently heard you on the PBS NewsHour and NPR, I see your perspectives in JAMA and other journals. (For example, this week Iheard NPR piece and read JAMA opinion piece on coronavirus.) In every instance, Iam struck again by how clearly you articulate the science, the issues for public concern, and options for our nation's response.

While I've worked with many public health leaders and watched others in the media over the past 35 years of my Maternal and Child Health public policy career, I believe no one is better at communications than you.  It is in some ways a thank less job. I am writing to say that your continuing leadership and dedication to our nation's health is deeply appreciated by me and millions of others.

The FDA for years has mostly stayed out of the debate around drug prices I Jacquelyn Martin, File/AP Photo

Updated: 01/31/2020 05:28 PM EST
New FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn faced a jam-packed agenda: opioids,CBD, vaping, and how to let
states safely import drugs. Then the Wuhan coronavirus broke out.
The virus was declared a public health emergency by HHS just a few hours after Hahn's exclusive interview with POLITICO Friday. That kicks the agency into overdrive  in multiple roles - helping speed vaccine, drug and diagnostic  test development  while  also trying to avoid shortages of drugs and devices the United States needs that are made in China.

Hahn said there have not been any reports yet of disruption of the supply chain or shortages, but the agency is looking ahead and planning for "what could potentially be the most serious of scenarios." As of now FDA inspections in China are being conducted on a case-by-case basis.

"We are taking on an individual-by-individual basis what's the regulatory need for anything in China ... versus what are the personnel risks associated," he said.
Monitoring the the situation in China could soon get trickier as the State Department expands mandatory evacuation from affected areas of the country.
The coronavirus also broke out in an election year when President Donald Trump wants to deliver on his promise to bring down drug prices - not traditionally the province of the FDA,a regulatory agency designed to focus on safety and efficacy.
"If my patients couldn't get access to something because of cost - that was a real problem for me as a doctor . Now I'm on the other end of that, but what can we do to make sure that that pipeline flows in the best way possible?" said Hahn, 60, an oncologist, researcher and Washington newcomer.
Hahn was confirmed as commissioner on Dec. 18, the night before the administration announced its plan to let states import cheaper medicines from Canada - an approach that prior FDA commissioners opposed over fears it would jeopardize the safety of the drug supply .Trump has endorsed letting states such as Florida do this.

"There is a compelling reason that the American people want us to consider this and so we're going to have to figure this one out and balance both of those issues," Hahn said, referring to safety and affordability.

The FDA for years has mostly stayed out of the debate around drug prices; the agency doesn't regulate the cost of medicines or health insurance coverage. But Hahn talked up FDA's role in getting prices down by approving more generics, acknowledging that "the American people are expecting us to do more." Trump has touted the FDA's record on boosting competition via generic approvals .
As FDA works on finalizing the importation rule, Hahn said the agency will be open to addressing criticism that states can't save money bringing in drugs from Canada if the pathway is too burdensome. But he stressed safety is tantamount. "Our primary concern is the protection of the drug supply," he said.
Hahn said he has also talked with CMS Administrator Seema Verma about addressing costs of new brand-name products that are approved with limited data sets, similar to the way CMS decides to cover some medical devices. That approach - known as coverage with evidence development - lets CMS cover a new product on the condition that manufacturers keep providing data.
FDA has not done that, but new medicines are increasingly being approved on smaller clinical trials without hard data on clinical benefits - and can come with six-figure price tags.
As an academic, Hahn had co-written an editorial suggesting that payments for newly approved radiation oncology devices coul d be l inked to older products until enough evi dence buil ds up to show that the new products are superior .Only then would manufacturers have more pricing leeway.
"It's a CMS call about coverage with evidence development, but Ido think in this world where we are concerned, and rightfully so,about the cost of medicine and health et cetera, that we should be looking at all avenues to approach that," he told POLITICO.
Over the last few years, some critics have said the FDA is overcorrecting and moving too quickly to approve drugs without adequate evidence. But Hahn did not indicate he would put the brakes on.
"At the end of the day there is this balance between the gold standard and being efficient and getting things in people's hands I'm totally confident in the agency's ability to do that."
Hahn must balance all that while leading the FDA's response to the Wuhan crisis, which has heightened some lawmakers' concern about U.S. reliance on Chinese drug manufacturing after incidents of contamination with carcinogens.
"We have to be concerned about the supply chain to make sure that we have enough of what we need if there are any potential outbreaks here," Rep.Susan Brooks (R-lnd.) said after a closed-door briefing Thursday for Energy and Commerce committee members with top health officials .The fact that China manufactures much of the protective medical gear used in U.S. hospitals and clinics "should cause us to be reexamining what we're doing in China versus what should be brought back to this country." she
said.
Outside of the coronavirus, a host of thorny regulatory issues await Hahn. Industry and lawmakers have pressed for a clear FDA framework on selling cannabidiol, the popular hemp and marijuana byproduct decriminalized by the 2018 farm bill - and since sold as medicine, dietary supplements and infused in food, cosmetics and skincare products.
"You cannot walk down the street without seeing the products" but there is a dearth of solid data on
how safe and effective CBD actually is, said Hahn.
Those CBD challenges have fueled larger discussions about how to better regulate the vast dietary supplement market, where manufacturers often push legal boundaries by making unverified claims about how herbal or homeopathic products can help people.
"It will be something else next," said Hahn.We don't want to overstep our bounds but we want to make sure that safe and effective products are in the hands of people."

The paper you sent me says the experiments were perfom1ed before the gain of function pause but have since been reviewed and approved by NTH. Not sure what that means since Emily is sure that no Coronavirus work bas gone through the P3 framework. She will try to determine if we have any distant ties to this work abroad.

Wuhan  Coronavirus Dear  Dr. Fauci.
Wondering if you have see the coronavirus treatment news. Iknow you were involved in Ebola previously. You are
a great Scientist and Doctor.
Coronavirus update: WHO says prepare for local coronavirus outbreaks in other countries; What do you think about this treatment.
Regards,
Amit

SHELTON, CONNECTICUT -- Thursday,January 30, 2020 -- NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSE Amer.: NNVC) (the "Company"), a global leader in the development of highly effective antiviral therapies based on a novel nanomedicin es platform, is confirm ing public disclosures in articles by various industry journals and other articles, that it is worki ng on developing a treatment for the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, or the Wuban coronavirus.

"We have already initiated a program for developing a treatment for the 2019-nCOV," said Anil R. Diwan, PhD, President and Executive Chairman of the Company, adding, "Our platform technology enables possibly the most rapid pathway for n ew drug development against v iral diseases. Of course, we wi II need support from governmental and international  agencies such as the US CDC, WHO, and Chinese CDC to successfully develop these treatments, and, if developed, to get them to the patients in the fastest possible time. At this time, the Company does not have a collaboration with any of these agencies, and we have not been contacted by any of these entities or asked to  develop a treatment for this virus. We had collaboratioDS with the CDC aDd USAMRTTD in the past. The Company intends to pursue a relevant collaboration  for testing of our drug candidates soon ."

The new 20 19-nCoV is known to be closely related to the SARS-CoV of 2002-2003 epidemic. In fact it has been
shown to use the same cell surface receptor as SARS-CoV, namely ACE2.

"We have already found some lead candidate ligands in our chemical library that can bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein in the same fashion as it binds to the cognate receptor, ACE2, using molecu lar modeling tools," explained Dr. Diwan, add ing, "We believe this means we may already be significantly ahead in developing a potential treatment for the new Wuhan virns."

While the Company commissions synthesis of the anti-nCoV nanoviricide drug candidates for testing, some of  which are already in our hands, in parallel, the Company has also started preparing for testing of the candidates  in cell cultures against certain known BSL2 coronaviruses , including ones that use the A.CE2 receptor. Less tbreatful viruses in the same family that use the same receptor can serve as valid test viruses for screening our broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidates . The Company ha> its own BSL2-certified virology laboratory at its Shelton campus where

it intends to perform this testing.

The Company has its own cGMP -capable drug manufacturin g facility. This highly customizable facility can be employed to produce several thousand doses of drugs per batch for treating coronavirus patients, if the Company's drug successfully transitions to obtaining an exploratory treatment approval for use in patients.

The Company's platform technology has already proven that it can result in safe drugs. The Company's first IND­ ready clinical drug candidate, namely NV-HHV- 10I,has successfu lly undergone a standard battery of Safety and Toxicological testing, as previously disclosed by the Company in press releases and SEC filings.

The Company is building on its previous work against coronaviruses. The Company's technology relies on copying the human cell-surface receptor to which the virus binds, and making small chemicals that are called "ligands" that will bind to the virus in the same fashion as the cognate receptor. These ligands are chemically attached to a
nanomic elle, to create a nanoviricide®. It is anticipated that when a virus comes in contact w ith the nanoviricide, not only would it land on the nanoviricide surface, binding to the copious number of ligands presented there, but it
wou ld also get entrapped because the nanomicelle polymer wou ld tum around and fuse with the virus lipid envelop, harnessing a well known biophysical phenomenon.

"It is like a 'Venus-Fly-Trap' for the virus," explained Dr. Diwan.

The Company focuses on developing broad-spectrum ligands and, thereby, broad-spectrum nanoviricides , copying the specific human cellular receptor. No matter how much a virus mutates, it lands on the same cell surface receptor, and binds in the same fashion. Thus, it is highly unlikely that a virus might escape a nanoviricide against it, in spite of mutations.

Tn 2014, the Company had worked on developing antiviral treatments against MERS-CoV, and coronaviruses in general. lt bad developed potential candidates for testing in animal models. The MERS-CoV threat was eclipsed by the Ebola epidemic of2015. The Company developed viable drug candidates against Ebola in a rapid response time of a few weeks and sent them for testing to USAMRJTD. These initial candidates showed significant activity. The Company believes that another cycle of optimization would have resulted in a candidate ready for animal testing under the criteria establ ished by USAMRHD then.

Dming th ese previous crises, the Company did not have the modern labs, the cGMP drug manufa cturing facility or
the BSL2 virology testing facility, all of which were commissioned after 2015 at its modern campus in Shelton, CT.

The Company is preparing an IND application for its first clinical drug candidate to go into human clinical lrials. This drug candidate, NV-HHV-101, is a skin cream with the treatment of shingles rash as its first indication. lt has shown broad-spectrum activity against HSY-1 (cause of "cold sores"), HSY-2 (cause of "genital ulcers"), and VZV (the varicella-zoster virus, that causes chickenpox in children and immune-com prom ised humans, and shingles in adu lts).

NY-HHV-10 l has already gone through standard battery of safety-toxicological  testing, which provides confidence that our platform is capable of creating safe drugs.

The Company has its own cGMP-capable drug manufa cturing facility where it intends to produce the drugs for clinical supply.

The Company's top priority remains working on its first IND application for NV-HHV-101. The Company intends
to solicit interest and financing from government agencies in order to accelerate its work on the coronaviruses.

The market size for the treatment of shingles is estimated at approximately one billion dollars by various estimates. These estimates take into account the Shingrix® vacci ne as well as existing vaccines. About 500,000 to Imillion cases of shingles occur in the USA alone every year.

The market size for om·immediate target drugs in the HerpeCide program is variously estimated at billions to tens of billions of dollars. The Company believes that its dermal topica l cream for the treatment of shingles rash will be

its first drug heading into clinical trials. The Company believes that additional topical treatment candidates in the HerpeCideTM program, namely, HSV-1 "cold sores" treatment, and HSV-2 "genital ulcers" treatment are expected to follow the shingles candidate into IND-enabling development and then into human clinical trials. These additional candidates are based on NV-HHV-101, thereby maximizing return on investments and shareholder value.

The Company develops its class of drngs, that we call nanoviricides®, using a platform technolo&'Y·This approach enables rapid development of new drngs against a number of different viruses. A nanoviricide is a "biomimetic" - it is designed to "look like" the cell surface to the virus. The nanoviricide® technology enables direct attacks at multiple points on a virus particle. It is believed that such attacks would lead to the virus particle becoming ineffective at infecting cells. Antibodies in contrast attack a virus particle at only a maximum of two attachment points per antibody. In addition, the nanoviricide technology also simultaneously enables attacking the rapid intracellular reproduction of the virus by incorporating one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APis) within the core of the nanoviricide. The nanoviricide technology is the only technology in the world, to the best of our knowledge, that is capable of both (a) al'tacking extracellular virus, thereby breaking the reinfection cycle, and simultaneously (b) disrupting intracellular production of the virus, thereby enabling complete control of a virus infection.

Dear Tony


I am delighted to inform you that WHO is organizing a global research partners forum on February 11th

and 12th in Geneva, to discuss research priorities related to the novel Corona virus.The expected outcome is a research roadmap with clearly defined priorities and a governance framework to take each themat ic area forward. Several thematic areas will be considered at the meeting, namely: virus, diagnostics; natural history and transmission; clinical; therapeutics; vaccines; ethics; regulatory science; animal health; data/samples analysis and sharing and; social sciences .We believe that this meeting will be critical in consensus building on the most important research questions, as well as in building global partnerships and collaborations to take this wor k forward.

This meeting is being organized in partnership with GLOPID Rand is being supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, DFID,Wellcome Trust and severa lother partners. The secretariat within WHO is the R&D blueprint, co-chaired by Dr Mike Ryan and myself.

As the head of an agency that would play an important role in addressing this new viral outbreak, either by undertaking or funding research, or both, Itake great pleasure in inviting you to this meeting. I apologize for the short notice, but you will understand that we have had to plan this in the past few days, keeping in mind the evolving situation.

Kindly let me know if you (or your nominee) will be able to attend and if you need any support from us. Please copy	(b)(6) and	(b)	in your response.

Mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the outbreak's origins
By Jon CohenJan. 31, 2020, 6:20 PM

That string of apparent gibberish is anything but: It's a snippet of a DNA sequence from the viral pathogen, dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), that is overwhelming China and frightening the entire world. Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from patients-53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database .These v iral genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species. They have also given glimpses into what this newly discovered virus physically looks like,how it's changing,and how it might be stopped .
"One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single introduction into humans and then human-to-human spread," says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in

Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market's environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan.
In all, 2019-nCoV has nearly 29,000 nucleotides bases that hold the genetic instruction book to produce the virus. Although it's one of the many viruses whose genes are in the form of RNA, scientists convert the viral genome into DNA, with bases known in shorthand as A, T, C, and G, to make it easier to study. Many analyses of 2019-nCoV's sequences have already appeared on virological.org, nextstra in.org, preprint servers like bioRxiv, and even in peer-reviewed journals. The sharing of the sequences by Chinese researchers allowed public health labs around the world to develop their own diagnostics for the virus, which now has been found in 18 other countries . (Science's news stories on the outbreak can be found here.)
When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available, researchers placed it on a family tree of known coronaviruses-which  are abundant and infect many species-and found that it was most closely related to relatives found in bats. A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the Wuhan
Institute of V irology, reported on 23 January on bi oRxi v that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% similar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outbreak was also in China more than 15 years ago. But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relationship to bat viruses, and sequence data make a powerful case that it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleotides. That's one reason why many scientists suspect there's an "intermedia ry" host species-or  several-between  bats and 2019-nCoV.
According to Bedford's analysis, the bat coronavirus sequence that Shi Zheng-Li's team highlighted, dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On nextstrain.org, a site he co­ founded, Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below} that include bat,civet, SARS,
and 2019-nCoV sequences. (The trees are interactive-by dragging a computer mouse over them, it's
.......-_·A	_	-
easy to see the differences and similarities between the sequences .)

Bedford's analyses of RaTG13 and 20 19-nCoV suggest that the two viruses shared a common ancestor 25 to 65 years ago,an estimate he arrived at by combining the difference in nucleotides between the viruses with the presumed rates of mutation in other coronaviruses . So it likely took decades for RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV.
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly has a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to huma ns from camels. And the phylogene tic tree from Shi's bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see.

The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that differentiate strains in infected people,and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very recently. But it remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. "There's a very large gray area between viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans," says Vince nt Munster, a virologist at the

U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and others species.
Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but w hether it
was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases-27 of the first 41 in one report,26 of 47 in another -were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful,were not.This raises the possibility that the initial j ump into people happened elsewhere .
According to Xinhua,the state-run news agency, "environmenta lsampling" of the Wuhan seafood market has found evidence of 2019-nCoV. Of the 585 samples tested, 33 were positive for 2019-nCoV and all were in the huge market's western portion, which is where wildlife were sold."The positive tests from the wet market are hugely important," says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who collaborated with the first group to publicly release a 2019-nCoV sequence. "Such a high rate of positive tests would strongly imply that animals in the market played a key role in the emergence of the virus."
Yet there have been no preprints or official scientific reports on the sampling, so it's not clear which, if any, animals tested positive. "Until you consistently isolate the virus out of a single species, it's really, really difficult to try and determine what the natural host is," says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research.
One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a

In the absence of clear conclusions about the outbreak's origin, theories thrive, and some have been scientifically shaky. A sequence analysis led by Wei Ji of Peking University and published online by the Journal of Medical Virology received substantial press coverage when it suggested that "snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV." Sequence specialists, however, pilloried i t. Conspiracy theories also abound. A CBC News report about the Canadian government deporting Chinese scientists who worked in a Winnipeg lab that studies dangerous pathogens was distorted on social
media to suggest that they were spies who had smuggled out coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of

Virology, which is the premier lab in China that studies bat and human coronaviruses, has also come under fire. "Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research," read a headline on a story in The Washington Post that focused on the facility.
Concerns about the institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new biosafety level 4 lab and included molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened with lab workers handling SARS in Beijing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an experiment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright questioned the accurac y of Bedford's calculation that there are at least 25 years of evolutionary distance between RaTG13-the virus held in the Wuhan virology
institute-and 2019-nCoV ,arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through different hosts before humans. Ebright tells 5ciencelnsider that the 2019-nCoV data are "consistent with entry into the human population as a natural accident."
Shi did not reply to emails from Science, but her longtime collaborator, disease ecologist Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, dismissed Ebright's conjecture. "Every time there's an emerging disease,a new virus, the same story comes out: This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus," Daszak says. "It's just a shame. It seems humans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face. There's this incredible diversity of viruses in wildlife and we've just scratched the surface .Within that diversity, there w ill be some that can infect people and within that group will be some that cause illness."



















A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the EcoHealth Alliance have trapped bats in caves all over China, like this one in Guangdong, to sample them for coronaviruses.
EcoHealth Alliance
Daszak and Shi's group have for 8 years been trapping bats in caves around China to sample their feces and blood for viruses. He says they have sampled more than 10,000 bats and 2000 other species. They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13-it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province. "We cannot assume that just because this virus from Yunnan has high sequence identity with the new one that that's the origin," Daszak says, noting that only a tiny fraction of coronaviruses that infect bats have been discovered. "I expect that once we've sampled and sampled and sampled across southern China and central China that we' re going to find many other viruses and some of them will be closer [to 2019-nCoV] ."

It's not just a "curious interest" to figure out what sparked the current outbreak, Daszak says."If we don't find the origin, it could still be a raging infection at a farm somewhere, and once this outbreak dies, there could be a continued spillover that's really hard to stop. But the jury is still out on what the real origins of this are."

Mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the

That string of apparent gibberish is anything but: It's a snippet of a DNA sequence from the viral pathogen, dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), that is overwhelming China and frightening the entire world .Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from patients-53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database. These viral genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species. They have also given glimpses into what this newly discovered virus physically looks like,how it's changing,and how it might be stopped .

"One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single introduction into humans and then human-to-human spread," says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing,combined with sampling the market's environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan.
In all, 2019-nCoV has nearly 29,000 nucleotides bases that hold the genetic instruction book to produce the virus. Although it's one of the many viruses whose genes are in the form of RNA, scientists convert the viral genome into DNA, with bases known in shorthand as A, T, C, and G, to make it easier to study. Many analyses of 2019-nCoV's sequences have already appeared on virol ogica l.org,nextstra in.org, preprint servers like bioRxiv, and even in peer-reviewed journals. The sharing of the sequences by Chinese researchers allowed public health labs around the world to develop their own diagnostics for the virus, which now has been found in 18 other countries. (Science's news stories on the outbreak can be found here.)
When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available, researchers placed it on a family tree of known coronaviruses-which are abundant and infect many species-and found that it was most closely related to relatives found in bats.A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the Wuhan
Institute of Virology, reported on 23 January on bi oRx i v that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% similar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outbreak was also in China more than 15 years ago. But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relationship to bat viruses, and sequence data make a powerful case that it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleotides. That's one reason why many scientists suspect there's an "intermediary" host species-or  several-between  bats and 2019-nCoV.
According to Bedford's analysis, the bat coronavirus sequence that Shi Zheng-Li's team highlighted, dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On nextstrain.org, a site he co­ founded, Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below) that include bat, civet, SARS, and 2019-nCoV sequences . (The trees are interactive -by dragging a computer mouse over them, it's easy to see the differences and similarities between the sequences.)

Bedford's analyses of RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV suggest that the two viruses shared a common ancestor 25 to 65 years ago, an estimate he arrived at by combining the difference in nucleotides between the viruses with the presumed rates of mutation in other coronaviruses. So it likely took decades for RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV .
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly has a link to bat viruses . But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels. And the phylogenetic tree from Shi's bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see.

The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that differentiate strains in infected people, and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very recently. But it remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. "There's a very large gray area between viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans," says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the
U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and others species.
Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but whether it was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases-27 of the first 41 in one report,26 of 47 in another-were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful,were not.This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere .

According to Xinhua,the state-run news agency, "environmenta lsampling" of the Wuhan seafood market has found evidence of 2019-nCoV. Of the 585 samples tested, 33 were positive for 2019-nCoV and all were in the huge market's western portion, which is where wildlife were sold. "The positive tests from the wet market are hugely important," says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who collaborated with the first group to publicly release a 2019-nCoV sequence. "Such a high rate of positive tests would strongly imply that animals in the market played a key role in the emergence of the virus."
Yet there have been no preprints or official scientific reports on the sampling, so it's not clear which, if any, animals tested positive. "Until you consistently isolate the virus out of a single species, it's really, really difficult to try and determine what the natural host is," says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research.
One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a batch of recently infected animals sold at different marketplaces. Or an infected animal trader could have transmitted the virus to different people at different markets.Or, Bedford suggests, those early cases could have been infected by viruses that didn't easily transmit and sputtered out. "It would be hugely helpful to have just a sequence or two from the marketplace [environmental sampling] that could illuminate how man  zoonoses occurred and when they occurred," Bedford says.

One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a batch of recently infected animals sold at different marketplaces. Or an infected animal trader could have transmitted the virus to different people at different markets. Or, Bedford suggests, those early cases could have been infected by viruses that didn't easily transmit and sputtered out. "It would be hugely helpful to have just a sequence or two from the marketplace [environmental sampling] that could illuminate how many zoonoses occurred and when they occurred," Bedford says.



















A research group sent fecal and other bodily samples from bats they trapped in caves to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to search for coronaviruses.

In the absence of clear conclusions about the outbreak's origin, theories thrive, and some have been scientifically shaky. A sequence analysis led by Wei Ji of Peking University and published online by the Journal of Medical Virology received substantial press coverage when it suggested that "snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV." Sequence specialists, however, pilloried it. Conspiracy theories also abound. A CBC News report about the Canadian government deporting Chinese scientists who worked in a Winnip eg lab that studies dangerous pathogens was disto rted on soci a l
media to suggest that they were spies who had smuggled out coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is the premier lab in China that studies bat and human coronaviruses, has also come

under fire. "Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research," read a headline on a story in The Washington Post that focused on the facility.
Concerns about the institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new
biosafety level 4 lab and included molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened with lab workers handling SARS in Beijing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an experiment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright questioned the accuracy of Bedford's calculat ion that there are at least 25 years of evolutionary distance between RaTG13-the virus held in the Wuhan virology
institute-and 2019-nCoV, arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through
different hosts before humans. Ebright tells Sciencelnsider that the 2019-nCoV data are "consistent with entry into the human population as a natural accident."
Shi did not reply to emails from Science, but her longtime collaborator, disease ecologist Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, dismissed Ebright's conjecture. "Every time there's an emerging disease, a new virus, the same story comes out: This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus," Daszak says. "It's just a shame. It seems humans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face. There's this incredible diversity of viruses in wildlife and we've just scratched the surface. Within that diversity, there will be some that can infect people and within that group will be some that cause illness."



















A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the EcoHealth Alliance have trapped bats in caves all over China, like this one in Guangdong, to sample them for coronaviruses.
EcoHealth Alliance
Daszak and Shi's group have for 8 years been trapping bats in caves around China to sample their feces and blood for viruses. He says they have sampled more than 10,000 bats and 2000 other species. They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13-it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province. "We cannot assume that just because this virus from Yunnan has high sequence identity with the new one that that's the origin," Daszak says, noting that only a tiny fraction of coronaviruses that infect bats have been discovered . "I expect that once we've sampled and sampled and sampled across southern China and central China that we're going to find many other viruses and some of them will be closer [to 2019-nCoV]."
It's not just a "curious interest" to figure out what sparked the current outbreak, Daszak says. "If we don't find the origin, it could still be a raging infection at a farm somewhere, and once this outbreak

dies, there could be a continued spillover that's really hard to stop. But the jury is still out on what the
real origins of this are." Posted in:
